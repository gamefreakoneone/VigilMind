Like we talked about this before, but like going to McDonald\\'s. >> Yeah, I was going to say yo, corporations, let\\'s go, dude. It was sick, dude. It was sick. It was sick, man. Gamers, welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste. I\\'m your host, Connor. Once again, joined by the boys and God. So, >> uh, yeah. >> Look, the one thing people always yap about online is things were better when I was a kid. So, we\\'re going to put it to the test today. >> We\\'re going to be doing >> 2005 versus 2025. We\\'re going to share a bunch of different things and we just decide which one\\'s better. Is end shitification real? Does that get what get you demonetized? >> Shitification. >> End shitification. >> It end. >> Well, you said the word. I\\'ve never heard of that term. >> What? You haven\\'t? >> No. >> It\\'s like the term for like things just getting worse over time. >> Clearly you\\'re not a Redditor. >> Clearly you don\\'t have I take pride in that. >> Clearly you don\\'t have deep discussions, Joey. >> I do. Just not on [\\xa0__\\xa0] Reddit. >> We know. You know how it\\'s like, you know, you have Google and Google once did the job it was and then it now gets worse with all these ads and stuff that would be inification. I see. where like something that was good and provided a great service slowly gets worse over time due to like adding bloat and stuff or just getting worse or like how you have like >> Yeah, I would just say it got [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> and shitification. >> Yes. >> So, this going to be a short segment for trash taste >> where our producers Well, we we we think it\\'s going to be a short >> talk and we\\'ll just talk it out. You know how it is. >> That is the show. But our producer has uh picked a few categories for us to discuss on whether things are better now and whether things are better before. And uh we\\'re going to try and keep our nostalgia goggles off and try to look at this, >> you know, objectively as poss as objectively as possible. >> Question, how old are you in 2005? >> I was about to ask. Yeah, we need to we need to set the boundaries of like 2005 for I think all three of us was very different stages of our lives. >> I was nine. I was 15. I was 11. >> Damn you old. >> Damn. >> Damn. No, I\\'m kidding. No, I\\'m >> kidding. Five was 20 years ago. >> Yeah. See, so like to a 9year-old experiencing this and a 15year-old experiencing this I feel is going to be very different >> based on like how you remember. >> Yeah, probably. >> You know. >> Yeah. But you know back then as well things had longer lifespans. So there was, you know, it\\'s realistic that maybe I could have been consuming something that maybe gone. >> Or did it feel like it was longer because you were younger? >> No, cuz things move really fast when you were a kid, >> I guess. So yeah. >> Do you do you identify yourself? >> No. Yeah. I was I was like, what? >> Do you still want to be uh relatable to the Jenzers, Joey? >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] no. >> I can\\'t relate to these kids. Are you kidding me? >> I fully embraced my status. I I realize there are two types of millennials. >> Yes. >> There\\'s there\\'s the type that enjoys K-pop demon hunters and the and the types that don\\'t. >> And the true millennials demon hunters was good. What do you mean, God? It was good. >> That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. >> That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. Anything to do with being a millennial? >> I think it does. >> I don\\'t even Is it? It is the great divider from what I\\'ve seen there. Like >> I don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] with K-pop, but I thought it was good. >> I thought it was good. I just couldn\\'t relate to it at all. >> No, I couldn\\'t relate to any of it. >> Yeah. I I was object like objectively I\\'m like, \"Oh, this is this is really really good. This is cool that it\\'s it gave it gave me the same vibe of appreciating something that another generation would appreciate more than myself because I don\\'t I don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] with like K-pop, you know, and I thought it was like some really really I don\\'t know why this is starting off with K-pop demon hunting. >> You brought this. >> You did this. >> We\\'re going right to the deep end.\" But I I I noticed it was just like I I can\\'t put my finger on it, but the energy of it was like super Gen Z, right? >> Uh and it was something that I was like, \"This is some really really cool stuff that just does not appeal to me, but I can still appreciate it, you know?\" >> Yes. Yes. Yes. >> Um that\\'s the point I was trying to make. >> No, no, no. I No, I agree. It\\'s like I I never really I personally never really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with K-pop and but I s I saw it and I was like that\\'s cool. I can I can appreciate that for what it is, but >> do I connect to it on a personal level? No. >> It\\'s like, would you rewatch it yourself without a mate watching it? >> I didn\\'t even watch it the first time by myself, >> right? >> I got it introduced to someone younger than me. >> Yes, that\\'s the point. >> You know, in a different timeline, we could have been the ones saving the Horn Moon. That could have been us. We could have been singing it. You know, you you guys, this attitude of yours is the reason why we\\'ll never save the world. >> We\\'re the We\\'re the We\\'re the meant to be. All right. Well, >> my gym has been spamming that. >> I\\'m also more critical of music just in general, though, so that might also be just a me thing. >> Uh, sure. >> Yeah, but anyway, that\\'s not the point. >> I don\\'t know. Sorry. >> Which category is K-pop in there? Cuz let\\'s just go to >> Let\\'s go straight to the >> Yeah, there\\'s a ton of categories that our producer Alex has like given us big. So, I you know, it\\'s 20 years, so there\\'s going to be quite a big uh jump in uh the vibe and everything, but I guess we\\'ll see. >> Will nostalgia win, or is it actually better now? >> Trash tastes better in 2005. >> Come on. Could you imagine if we started in 2005? >> Oh, Jesus Christ. >> Anime Zone was almost just about to cook in 2005. That sounds so weird. >> All right, let\\'s learn then. >> All right. >> Okay. Yeah, sure. >> Okay, so we\\'re going to be given 3x3s of 2005 and 2025. All right, so video games. Let\\'s start with video games. Um, okay. >> So, these are games that have come >> in. >> This is also really going to speak volumes to what Alex [Music] >> viewers, this is not meant to be these are the nine games to represent the year. It is like this is a feeling of the year to get a vibe. >> Yeah. Like of the type of game specifically 2005 versus 2025. It\\'s more of just like now versus then. Correct. >> Yeah. Yeah, I say I would say it\\'s closer to like the naughties versus the the 2020s. >> That might be the >> 2020s called >> the naughties. >> No, no, no. The >> 2020s. Oh, no. We stop. We gave up with that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> It\\'s the roaring 20s again. >> We gave up. We gave up with that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Go back to the roaring 20s, but we\\'re roaring for a different reason entirely. >> What were the 2010s called again? I know that had a name. >> Does it? I think it does. >> I would just say the 2010s. >> The 20 the the tenzies. The the tenzies. just asking kids bopification. >> That\\'s what\\'s that\\'s what the naughty sounds like. >> Sorry, we\\'re getting off topic. >> I\\'m not the one that [\\xa0__\\xa0] coined the term naughties, bro. >> I\\'m just saying. Um, >> so why don\\'t we first of all write down our answer. >> Which one was better? >> Yeah. And then we\\'ll >> we can discuss. >> Okay. >> Okay. >> We can discuss. >> Okay. So, which one which one would you prefer? >> 2005 or 2025? Hm. Okay. H >> I\\'d actually have to think about this one. Uh, >> I wonder if we\\'re going to get the same answer on any of these. >> I think that\\'s going to be the most interesting thing. >> I want to change. >> You changed. >> Yeah, I want to change. >> I want to change. But but yeah, I mean, this is so tough. >> Yeah. I mean, >> there\\'s no correct answer, but All right. Ready? Three, two, one. >> Oh, damn. We all said 2025 for video games. >> I had it as 2005 originally and then I saw Expedition 33 and I was like, >> mm- let me change that. >> Oh, you saw Expedition 33 years? >> Yeah. I was like, wait, they came out this year and I, as much as I love a lot of these games, Super Mario Strikers especially is a soft spot in my heart. Banger >> cuz that was the game I put the most hours into on the Gamecube. >> The only soccer game I ever played. Well, yeah, because and also like I if you were like, \"Can I name games from 2004?\" I wouldn\\'t be able to name. >> Well, do you think games are better now in general? I think is the question more than um >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> I think games are better now. >> I think games are better now. >> I think the the gaming medium is taking itself more seriously. >> Mhm. >> Uh and has more resources. In the same sense though, at the same time, I think games like the skew of it is worse. Like big games that are absolute dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] are way more than they used to be. Mhm. But the the the cream of the crop is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] good now. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Absolutely. >> But we\\'re so spoiled. We have so much choice now, too. >> Yeah. >> Where like, >> so what if 30 games that should have been good suck ass? Cuz there\\'s 20 games that I never heard about that are going to blow my mind this year. >> Yeah. I I would say if the question was not video games but the gaming industry, it\\'s okay then than then then yeah, >> the gaming industry was a lot better back then. I think in general though now we just are living in an era where no matter what your tastes, no matter what you look for in a video game, there\\'s probably going to be something for you. And I don\\'t think that was that was always the case. before you\\'d basically have to pick between three different platforms obviously um and you\\'d have to hope that that year there was a release that year that\\'s t that was uh catered towards your tastes >> and that\\'s why so many of the games I grew up with were games that I replayed to you know >> high over because there wasn\\'t as many other games within that niche that I enjoyed so I would replay those games over and over now you finish a game and you have like 10 different games that you could be playing. Does that means that games are less special? >> I don\\'t know. But, you know, I I can\\'t say I\\'m as bored as I was before >> because the argument could be said that like, you know, back in 2005, you know, when we were all just collectively younger, there was more of that kind of sense of mystery >> to like new games coming out because, you know, there was less games out there and there wasn\\'t as much of an access to say like the internet for example that you could like connect to with other community members or, you know, maybe get like a walkthrough or a guide or anything like that, right? So 2025 is obviously better in the sense of like the community being easier to be created and talked about, but you know at the same time like I feel like games nowadays especially a lot of the games on that right side there that sense of mystery is still there even with walkthroughs and like you know community that\\'s there to like hold your hand sometimes and like I don\\'t know. Yeah. And and again, the best part about 2025 is that >> if I want to go back and play the 2005 games, I can do so much easier than back in 2005. >> Mhm. >> You know, back in 2005, you needed either the console or a computer strong enough to run it, which not everybody had. >> Nowadays, most people who are into games have a computer that\\'s strong enough to play >> pretty much every game since. So, it\\'s just easier in that sense if you want to go back. But I think games nowadays still have that, you know, at least the good ones have that still that sense of mystery. >> Yeah. >> And like new refreshing ideas, especially in the indie scene >> that is like just as good, if not better. >> Here\\'s the real question, though. >> Would you rather be in only in terms of video game terms, would you rather be a teenager growing up in the 2005ish era or the now 2025ish era? >> 2005. >> 2005. >> You think so? I think because you got more holistic packages of games >> whereas now you know live service games are a massive thing like you know when we were growing up it was like you got the new COD every year. >> Yeah. >> Uh and in between that you would kind of play different games but now you can just play Fortnite. >> Yeah >> cuz every month they got so new. >> Yeah. >> Uh and there\\'s a lot of other games you can play as well. a lot a lot of games that are popular that are live service like you know you show these games but like those are the games I was playing as a kid these are not the games that kids are playing nowadays >> no they\\'re not >> right so this is almost like >> 2005 kid versus 2025 adult >> because a a kid is not going to be playing all these games maybe they\\'ll play Dunkanza maybe they\\'ll play Mario World a kid is not playing any of these games really >> a kid is not playing Oblivion >> that exclusively like plus 25 mostly, right? I mean, obviously I\\'m you know >> I can\\'t imagine like a 14-year-old playing Death Stranding too, >> right? I mean, obviously obviously my my friends when they were 13 were playing uh Skyrim and Oblivion. So that\\'s obviously maybe that\\'s not that\\'s a bad point, but I feel like people who would be playing the remake of Oblivion probably, you know, it\\'s not a kid. It\\'s probably a guy with a good gaming PC, loves >> modding. I think there are certain games in 2025 that have just become a lot more homogenized. You know, like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox. >> It\\'s every it\\'s the community aspects in those kinds of games are much more prevalent now, I think, just because every other kid is playing them. >> So, everyone kind of has a similar experience in terms of like the games that they played. Meanwhile, all three of us, we grew up on, you know, seemingly totally different games despite growing up in the same era. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But I think there was always an appreciation of the other games that I didn\\'t get to play for either financial reason reasons or just cuz I didn\\'t choose to. Yeah. >> Um >> but yeah, I mean like again like if this was 2005 games versus kids games or games that you would be playing at like at the same age, it would be 100% 2005. But like obviously the peak of gaming now is as such that I think it\\'s it\\'s so [\\xa0__\\xa0] good. >> But there was also a lot of slop back then as well. >> Oh, totally. >> Like even pre205 uh >> NES, >> let\\'s talk about constant movie games. Every every [\\xa0__\\xa0] AAA movie or something like every big movie had to have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh a game counterpart. Like I don\\'t know when the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Lost video game came out, the series Lost. That was a game that I bought. I bought it exclusively because it was easy to get all the achievements on, but like nobody thinks about these [\\xa0__\\xa0] dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] games that also came out around this time. And it\\'s so easy to look back and think like, wow, Shadow of the Colossus, but like there wasn\\'t as many. Whereas I feel like now there are so many good games coming out just because of the sheer fact there are infinitely more games being released. >> Yeah. uh that it yeah you you are you are very sport for choice. >> Yes, >> totally. >> And yeah, I don\\'t know. I I feel like it\\'s it\\'s such a hard argument to make because it also depends on what genre you are a huge fan of. >> Like if you like shooters >> and you were a big shooter guy, maybe you [\\xa0__\\xa0] loved the 2010s >> cuz that was when like peak like everyone was playing shooters. Everyone was playing >> the peak of different genres happened at different timelines, right? Yeah, like JRPG, you know, you could argue the SNES console was like the king and so many good games came out for the NES or JRPGs. >> Uh, you know, whereas for a long time there hadn\\'t been quite a lot of big ones cuz there\\'s a lot of consoles that were struggling to find the right platform for them. >> Uh, and now I feel like there\\'s been a bit of a resurgence in RPGs as well. But then 2005 was also like the peak of when Game Boy Advance games came out. And there were 95% of Game Boy Advance games are just absolute ass and just completely forgettable. >> Nintendo DS had some truly dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Oh yeah. >> games on it. >> Uh you know, you would get the Super Mario Brothers and that was great and that would carry you, but then your mom would buy you some weirdass movie tie-in >> like Edge of Tomorrow. You\\'re like, \"What the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is it? Doesn\\'t even look like Tom Cruz.\" like just so many weird things that you forget about because you block them out because you remember booting up Super Mario Strikers with your friend and playing for 9 hours cuz that was so peak. >> Um >> but yeah, I don\\'t know. So I think >> but then on on to play Devil\\'s Advocate gaming is also more frustrating than it\\'s ever been >> in terms of you know you you when you bought uh Super Mario Strikers or any game on the the Gamecube, it ran on the Gamecube. Yeah. >> Now, when you buy some Switch games, some of them don\\'t even [\\xa0__\\xa0] run on the Switch properly. >> And like, how frustrating is that to new consumers trying to get into gaming or kids trying to explain to them actually the graphics cards in the Steam Deck is not good enough, so you can\\'t play that game. It\\'s like this is [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is like cryptic as [\\xa0__\\xa0] to >> it\\'s like trying to find like read the reigos language when actually that\\'s just um >> unknown. No, rejigus is just um >> Morse code. Yeah, more. >> So, not not that hard actually. But, >> you know, uh PC is really annoying to use. Some you boot up a [\\xa0__\\xa0] PlayStation, ask do you want performance or uh picture mode? You\\'re like, what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is this? Just let me play the game. >> Like, it is gaming has become so much shittier >> uh and has become a lot more of an expensive hobby. >> Yeah. >> Uh than it wasn\\'t really. I mean, gaming actually was quite expensive before, too, but in a very different way and in a way that didn\\'t feel like you were being taken advantage of. Yeah, just >> free to play is like makes up most of the the most of the gaming revenue is made up from freeto play games which I think is objectively not objectively but I think it\\'s worse for gamers in general cuz I think it ends up in making games sometimes be worse off >> than when they would be. >> I think do you not like live service games then? >> I don\\'t really like live service games. I >> I don\\'t know. I really like a complete complete package. Yeah, >> I don\\'t mind a DLC. I don\\'t mind uh >> you know, I know the new thing is the whole act one with the Delta Rune. They do acts. I don\\'t mind that. I understand the development has gotten very expensive. >> Um and people should be paid appropriately. >> And so sometimes you just have to release it in unconventional ways. >> That\\'s fine. >> It just sucks to boot up a game, [\\xa0__\\xa0] with it so much, and then they\\'re like, \"All right, come back in 12 hours and you have more energy.\" Or, \"Hey, you could speed up a lot of things if you pay a couple of bucks.\" You\\'re like, \"I just I would just love to be on the same page as everyone else. Like Dark Souls would [\\xa0__\\xa0] suck if you got like Dark Souls 3II and like, oh, struggling there a little bit. Oh, you can actually get the uh Dangarth\\'s the Blade of the Wise. If you just buy the season pass, you\\'re like, \"God, damn it. God damn it. I just wanted to play the game and just progress.\" Today\\'s episode of Trash Taste is sponsored by Zogdoc.

Back to the episode. >> I think as well like the one ranting. >> No, no, no. I completely agree. I think as well like the one thing that 2005 at least like the and you know maybe this is a result of the fact that we were just younger. Or maybe it\\'s just a sign of the times. But like I feel like the whole concept of just like LAN and just playing in the same room >> Oh, dude. as another person is basically gone now. >> Well, whenever I go to LA, I always go to uh obviously the yard. >> They do uh they do penis star league. >> What? >> What? >> They call it penis star league. >> Okay. >> And they have headsets on one side that are all hooked up to some crazy expensive broadcasting system. >> Yeah. >> So, they all have we all play Search and Destroy, Modern Warfare 2, Halo 3, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2. >> Yeah. Yeah. and they have a whole like it\\'s sick and they just do like land nights where it\\'s like all right who wants to hop in. All right, we\\'ll swap teams. All right, this person\\'s winning too much. Let\\'s get so [\\xa0__\\xa0] high. >> Yeah, and that was the thing, right? Like, you know, sure you could buy Super Mario Strikers for instance, and just enjoy it as just like the oneplayer game. But the core reason why that game is so goated is because when you got a bunch of friends over, [\\xa0__\\xa0] land four controllers, and you just go absolutely ham on that game. That was where that game really shined. >> And I feel like now because it\\'s so easy to just like hop onto a server or hop onto a Discord and just like across the planet, which you know has this has its merits, don\\'t get me wrong, but it doesn\\'t I don\\'t know. Maybe this is my nostalgia talking, but like it doesn\\'t have the same excitement as being physically in a room together. >> Couldn\\'t be me. >> Couldn\\'t be me. No, I mean I I think this is just a result of of dev time like development time for games becoming so so much exponentially longer, you know, like I think that the the prime example of like of the the showcase of how games just take longer to make now is like look at the Final Fantasy release chart. >> Pull up like >> how often F and like >> mainline Final Fantasy, right? >> Yeah. mainline Final Fantasy game release and like maybe there\\'s a maybe there\\'s like a chart or something that will show us in like give us a good gap. I swear someone made one. No, no, that\\'s a list. Maybe there\\'s like a chart. >> There you go. Images >> images maybe. Or maybe you have a chart or something and it come up. >> Um Oh, there we go. This this kind of helps. Yeah. Yeah, this helps >> like open that up. And also at the same time, not not just Final Fantasy, but they made like Chrono Trigger >> uh in the Well, I guess actually at that point it would have just been that would have been >> was that just squareoft? >> Still Squareoft Square. >> Look at this run. >> Yeah, >> back to back to back. >> No, I see nothing but bangers. >> Like >> nothing but bangers, dude. >> Like I cannot like And when did Chrono Chrono Trigger release again? >> Chrono Trigger was 94. It was around the same time as five I believe 93 92 something like that 95 >> like a year after six >> like imagine [\\xa0__\\xa0] cooking up six and the next year you released Chrono Trigger >> like two games that have like shaped the entire medium like like unequivocally. Uh and then also even then onwards from that even when dev time got longer and they release um you know uh six seven cuz uh seven came out in 19 >> 97 >> 97 which is [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy as well. That came out 2 years after Chrono Trigger like that that run is is bonkers and then you see how long it takes now between this Final Fantasy and the one previous it is just so much harder to make games. And my point being is that like obviously when it is taking this long and the gap is getting so long between Final Fantasies. Uh yeah, it it you imagine you\\'re in a dev studio and especially when there\\'s a lot of money and it\\'s getting a lot more expensive and wages are higher and you have to sell a lot more copies otherwise people are going to lose their jobs. >> Yeah. You just don\\'t have [\\xa0__\\xa0] time to put in co-op. >> Only only probably like >> Nintendo maybe and indie games have the ability to be able to like prioritize stuff like this. But it\\'s no surprise that like a lot of studios are like that is by far at the bottom of the checklist. And then and then you also consider that half the [\\xa0__\\xa0] games nowadays release in an absolute appalling state. >> Yeah. They\\'re never like fully finished. >> I\\'m argu I I I said 25 was better but now I\\' I\\'ve argued for 20 minutes. >> Okay. Cuz I\\'m looking at this chart. Why gaming is you imagine in 5 years they released 7 8 9 and 10 >> in five years. >> That is like a generational ride. >> That is crazy. Like that is like got to be >> took a year between 9 and 10. That\\'s nuts. >> Yeah. To to have been a Final Fantasy fan from like six onwards knowing you were going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] eat every year must have been a godly feeling. I mean Pete could probably be on top. >> I mean there\\'s a reason why I think people like >> What happened after 10 then? >> Uh well they they changed. So the formula for Final Fantasy changed a lot. I think >> well they released 11 which was the MMO which which was not very good from what >> people people didn\\'t like. >> There\\'s still servers for it. It\\'s still >> there\\'s still so but but one of the biggest change this Pete told me this and I was like this blows my mind that this is the best one of the best quality of life fixes they did for 11 was increase the run speed by 35%. And apparently apparently that was a lifechanging thing for the gamers of that game. Like I was like that was like oh my god this game is playable. like how how badly do you have to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up where that change is like they\\'re like growling like this is amazing this is the best thing ever anyway they they they changed a lot went towards MMOs and stuff and obviously 14\\'s very successful but >> and thenious yeah >> now they\\'re trying to bring it back the traditional style Final Fantasy and obviously trying to modernize it but you know kind of struggling really cuz >> 15 didn\\'t do very well >> 15 was mid as hell >> and then 16 did well but I don\\'t think it met the sales that Square were hoping before. >> Yeah, 16 was >> 16 was eight. >> It\\'s It was cool. >> Yeah. >> It was cool. >> Um >> it was a good game. >> It was better than 15. That\\'s the phrasal. >> You know, it sucks cuz you\\'re like, damn. To have two games not perform really well in the space for like 10 years. You\\'re like, man, I just >> Scar is such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome studio at making stuff. It\\'s like, man, I just >> it it would suck if they weren\\'t able to make stuff. >> Stories or something else? >> There\\'s a lot to it. I mean, the the games are objectively harder to make. There\\'s so much mo cap now. Like, that\\'s a thing that like >> it\\'s become more and more and more cinematic since I\\'d say 12. >> Yeah. The cut scenes of 16 were insane. >> Yeah, they were. And like it is objectively amazing to watch, but just somehow >> it isn\\'t as gripping as these four sprites >> that are, you know, like just chatting, you know, and it it\\'s it\\'s really fascinating how, >> you know, obviously dev dev time is taking longer, which means that these studios taking much bigger risks, which is scary, I think. >> Yeah. >> Also why indie games are crushing right now. I I mean I\\'d say that there are still some great modern storylines and you know presentation is play plays a big factor obviously but you can\\'t get around >> uh you know good storytelling good characters good writing it\\'s it\\'s always going to come back to that whether it be a AAA title or just a small indie game you know >> uh you guys haven\\'t played God of War but that was such an amazing [\\xa0__\\xa0] game um that was cinematic and was very very >> I mean Last of Us too >> Last of Us >> obviously the second one people don\\'t really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with but the first one you know don\\'t know it was absolutely cinematic and kind of I think changed the style of of uh gaming very long >> exactly and obviously as you said expedition 33 as well >> amazingly cinematic great acting great story line uh so I I think in general uh Uh for myself playing Final Fantasy 16, it was like I think the biggest thing was the story that it was like uh it was it was lacking. >> It was it was it was all right. You know, >> unfortunately goes back to that. >> Storytelling is hard. >> It is very hard. >> Very very very very hard. >> Oh yes. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> But >> you know I it\\'s hard to say. >> Yes. All right. Should we move on to the next one? >> God, I miss Gale of Darkness. Dude, that was such a good game. >> I know. Take me back to 2005, bro. It\\'s such a good game. >> I tried in the UK to get that so much on [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Darkness and Colosseum. It made >> an expensive game to get so expensive now. All right. 2005 2025 Tech and Internet. >> This one\\'s Do we need to write this one down? >> What do you mean? >> Really? >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] It\\'s so simple for you. >> Yeah, it\\'s so simple. >> Hold on. I got to H. Yeah. All right. >> This one is simple as [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don\\'t want us all to have the same answers constantly, >> but like for this one. >> Okay. >> All right. Three. >> Wait, let me think. Let me think. >> Okay, I\\'ll go with this. >> Okay. Three, two, one. >> Yeah. [\\xa0__\\xa0] sake. >> Yeah, I kind of figured you were both going to do that. So, I was >> I mean, that\\'s why I was like, >> uh, for audio listeners, we should explain. We all picked >> We all picked 2005. 2005. >> I saw the CRT and I\\'m like, say less. So it\\'s not even it\\'s not even the explain maybe some of the tech in 2005 flip phones uh u which I think is still very much YouTube CRT Xbox 360 >> the iPod >> YouTube PSP iPod uh the Game Boy Mini which was micro which is dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] quite frankly >> MySpace versus the tech of nowadays which you can imagine very much so >> the Spotify the Tik Toks the AI >> well you know I mean I think 2020 tech I might have been a bit more lenient on. But it\\'s all this AI garbage that has absolutely >> Wait, why would you say 2020? >> Cuz they they weren\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] obsessed with shoving AI down your throat. >> No, no, it\\'s it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s AI. There\\'s always 20 the 2020s, I guess, has been the trend of whatever new hot tech fad has come out. Now it\\'s AI. Before it was NFTTS. Before that, it was like blockchain >> stuff. There\\'s always something new. >> 2005 was just the wild west for the internet. Like you just didn\\'t know what to expect. Everything was new. Nothing like it had existed before. And we\\'re very blessed, at least people in our generation are very blessed to be there basically. Well, it had to have experienced life before all of this and and at the birth of all of this as well. So it\\'s like yeah I guess if you if you look at it just even not even through like a nostalgia perspective just the fact that it just used to be simple but also just so exciting >> back in the day and then you look at it now and everything is like algorithmic everything is AI everything is over complicated and >> you know maybe I think modern tech is the reason for the degragation of modern society >> I mean yeah >> yeah I laughed but I\\'m like [\\xa0__\\xa0] he\\'s kind of spitting It\\'s like, okay, let\\'s ignore the fact it the power that we have, the computing power at least that we have at our fingertips now is better than ever, you know, um, functionality wise, quality of quality of life-wise. I feel like there\\'s so much tech there that is literally stepping backwards as opposed to stepping forwards for a >> mortification, >> huh, in shitification. A lot of aspects of our lives. Uh before you\\'d have modern tech that would bring new innovations that would genuinely bring a better quality of life for whatever function they were innovating in. And nowadays it feels like whatever new innovations um are coming up in the tech world some of the times they are actually making the product legitimately worse. >> Yeah. I I it\\'s there are some things that I really really like about modern tech >> and there are some things that I really don\\'t like. >> Uh and I don\\'t have the same po like polarizing view of all the technology even though there was some real stinkers back then as well. >> Yeah. >> Like torrenting was a lot shittier back then. Torrenting now is kind of kind of nice. It\\'s It\\'s a lot easier now. >> Wait, what are you talking about? >> Sorting is exactly the same. >> There are a lot more tools now to make it easier. Uh, and like sorting program, stuff like that. Like before, I remember having to, you know, when you downloaded the music and it was all like various artists on your thing and you go and get if you wanted the album pitch, you had to download it and stuff like that. Now you you can just download programs and do it all for you. >> I don\\'t know. I like that though. You like like Well, you you like it because you you imagine you\\'re in like a coffee shop and you\\'re like sorting your albums. You\\'re like, \"Yeah, >> no, not even coffee shop. I was on my [\\xa0__\\xa0] family computer and just being like, \"Oh, okay. I\\'m going to >> I like that now.\" You could if you were to pirate now, which obviously I don\\'t do that, but if I was, for example, you could have a home a home server and and you can use it on any device in the house and you can have this sorting thing that goes through your files, gets the subtitles, gets the the cover art, tells you who the director is, and oh wow, it\\'s like you have your But I would never do that obviously, but uh you could do that. Very >> theoretically, you could. >> Theoretically, you could do that. >> Um I\\'m sure one of the shitty AIS will walk you through it. Um but um >> but then there are also things that I think have gotten worse. >> Mhm. >> Like social media is unequivocally worse. >> Y >> it was kind of it was kind of hype back then. It was actually fun. There was less ads. Obviously they they were going to have to have ads at some point, >> but you would just get served only what your friends are up to. >> I didn\\'t have to worry what some [\\xa0__\\xa0] viral post was going on in America. It was like I just saw what Gant and Joey were doing on Facebook >> and it genuinely felt like machine. Yeah. There wasn\\'t a machine telling you what you think you might like more than what you think you might like. >> It was actually [\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome. >> Like you you felt like you were in control of the thing that you created in a weird way, right? Like >> it\\'s it\\'s not just that. This whole I one one of the big reasons why I think, you know, tech is inadvertently I I guess getting worse is because everything\\'s becoming so homogenized in literally everything. It\\'s, you know, the same the same apps, the same functionality, even the same there there is just far less choice that we have right now because we get fed what an algorithm or an AI program tells us that we think we should like and that >> we don\\'t even need to choose a video anymore. We just need to scroll. >> There\\'s no discovery anymore. >> Yeah. There\\'s there\\'s no discovery. there\\'s no um there\\'s no control over it, you know, in in in the in the best sense. I you I feel like a lot of the tech I interact with now, I just have a lot less control. You do a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Google search and you can\\'t even control the [\\xa0__\\xa0] search that you\\'re trying to search for because it feeds you whatever it whatever else it thinks you want. >> Um you try to search a video, have you ever tried searching a video on modern YouTube? Uh yeah, it just never gives you what you searched for. >> That is true. >> Yeah, it\\'s like >> the first five videos are just like that\\'s cool and all, but I think you should watch this instead. >> Oh, you know what also is terrible? When you buy something on Amazon, >> the like first 10 things are sponsored. >> Yeah, I hate that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> I if I ever buy anything on Amazon, I on purposefully I will not click any of the sponsored ones just be like, \"Fuck you. Yeah. Yeah. I don\\'t like you. I don\\'t like that you\\'re putting ads when I\\'m already paying you, [\\xa0__\\xa0] Stop that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah. I just remember like and you know, again, this might be as a result of being an 11year-old child during this era. But like just that whole sense of like mystery and wonder of like I don\\'t know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is out there. But when you find that one thing that you really resonate with that you didn\\'t even know maybe even existed >> and you\\'re like wo this thing is so cool. and then you look around and you\\'re like, \"Wait, no one else knows about this.\" And you know, it\\'s like this is my like little thing. I feel like that has just gotten so much harder nowadays because now information travels faster. Everyone is online now. And again, it\\'s like everyone, as you said, it\\'s like everything\\'s homogeneized. Like every everything leads back to the same five to 10 things that everybody shares, right? >> I don\\'t know if you feel this way, but uh a great joy back in 2005 was setting up a new device. It was fun to set up new devices >> and to like learn what they do. >> Now I [\\xa0__\\xa0] dread having to set up any [\\xa0__\\xa0] new device I get cuz I\\'m like god [\\xa0__\\xa0] damn it. >> Getting a new phone is actually like quite cumbersome >> like having to transfer everything over to a new phone. It is really shitty. >> I know that there\\'s like the the autoimp import and stuff but it\\'s never like perfect. You have to resign into everything. >> Yeah. It\\'s just it it\\'s kind of a bolic like using tech. Yes, it does enhance your life a lot in certain aspects. Uh but in other aspects it\\'s just worse. Like uh I I mean even like even me when I I know I I [\\xa0__\\xa0] live off Uber Eats. I probably shouldn\\'t have the ability to do that. I I recognize like I should probably be forced to cook and and do all this stuff. It\\'s great that I can\\'t. And also I I I know there are there are benefits people who you know this tech does help a lot of people who maybe would not have the ability to maybe take care of themselves. Like if you\\'re you know some people who are disabled it\\'s great that they can have these things cuz then maybe they they can\\'t cook for themselves. >> Yeah. >> Um and there are some tech that have absolutely helped in that capacity but like generally quality of life I feel like is worse. >> Yeah. >> Streaming services now have gotten to the point where it\\'s like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are we doing? Yeah. >> Like I I if you have more than like four streaming services like that you subscribe to. I feel like you\\'re just being taken advantage of. >> Yeah. >> Totally. >> Um >> you have you have submitted yourself to the AI overlord at this point. >> Gaming consoles are like okay the Switch is like really the only one that\\'s kind of like that feels worthwhile. PlayStation doesn\\'t really feel >> I mean what what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is the point of gaming consoles anymore? Like seriously aside from just convenience of just you know plug and play. I guess that was the whole point, right? The whole point was that it was like you could just hand it to anyone and they could figure it out. >> And I do think we\\'re losing that and it is a shame because I do think gaming on PC is still a little too intimidating to get into. >> Yeah. because there\\'s like, oh, your graphics card can\\'t run this game. Or even like the Steam Deck, which I\\'ve said multiple times, I think it is really like shitty handing a Steam deck to someone who doesn\\'t really understand gaming cuz they don\\'t understand why a game can\\'t run and why why it might run badly or how they could maybe improve the performance. Like >> it\\'s not it\\'s not like, hey, maybe you\\'re turning off all the shaders, you know, maybe or like the shadows to learn like that\\'s not intuitive to learn that stuff. >> Yeah. >> And nor should you have to. >> I don\\'t even know what that does. You know, like some of the settings I\\'m like, what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does this >> motion motion blur? >> I\\'m going to be real for a second. >> I have no idea what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] rate tracing is. >> And to be fair, I don\\'t actually care. Do you know what rate tracing is? >> No, I don\\'t game on PC for this exact reason. >> Okay, Ray tracing is old news, by the way. >> Okay, it is it is old and I I have already not I already don\\'t know what it is. Ray tracing from my understanding is like >> instead of you having to let\\'s say like design the light in the room and like have that be a thing that you have created. Ray tracing is like if you had an object like you put the sun somewhere in the room it will then naturally make that given the surroundings like show the lighting and make that lighting look >> so does that take more processing power? >> Yeah. >> Okay. But it looks better, >> right? >> And so that\\'s why you need the the >> rate. Can we can we can we can we >> Yeah. Can we get a comparison? >> Comparison. >> And also No, no, the big thing now is frame generation. That\\'s the big thing. >> Okay. >> What is rate tracing? Why should I care? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Light transport variety. Okay. I was I was somewhat close. >> Okay. So, >> whereas frame generation is the new thing. >> What\\'s frame generation? >> Well, so now it\\'s DL DSL. >> DLSS, right? uh DLSS, which I don\\'t I don\\'t know what that stands for. >> Mhm. >> But basically, when your computer is running a thing now, it basically has to make every single frame, whereas this new thing is that it will make one frame and use AI to make the rest of the frames. So, you get like a super high like AI like 400 FPS, >> okay? >> But like a like two/ird of the frames are like >> kind of like extrapolated from the one frame. >> I I don\\'t like that. I I don\\'t like the idea of that. It\\'s very popular. >> Yes. >> This episode is sponsored by Shopify. Boys, if you know me, then you know that I\\'ve been running a clothing brand called Nonsense.

Back to the episode. I\\'mma be real, man. Like I I look at that image and >> Yeah. I mean, yeah, but also not really. Joey Joey, >> it\\'s just meant to be like more realistic. That\\'s the idea. >> So, so >> I know Joey\\'s going to Joey couldn\\'t Joe couldn\\'t tell the difference between 60 and 140. So, I don\\'t want to I >> quite frankly I don\\'t. And I think practically that\\'s a >> Wait. So, okay. So, rate tracing is all on the left. Okay. What\\'s the difference? >> It\\'s more lighter. >> It\\'s better graphics. >> Yeah, I can see some of the lighting difference from the funnel. >> It\\'s It is It is meant to be a like onetoone simulation of physics. So that like if you put a light source >> instead of >> like you having to put more manual lighting and put like uh more effects. If you just put a sun >> in the thing, it will generate the lighting. >> Yeah. like organically. >> So, the big reason why like I never really cared about ray tracing and I guess this confirms it for me was because I look at this and I\\'m like, how does this make a better game? >> No, no, no, it doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t. But then this is >> But again, it\\'s how it\\'s more grounded in reality. >> How do I sell you a better mattress? No, no, that\\'s that\\'s the whole that\\'s the whole point when I talk about like innovation where there\\'s so many of these buzzwords about features that I don\\'t think, >> you know, brings any better, >> you know, any better quality of life for a product I\\'m trying to get. For example, in RA tracing, yes, you get slightly better graphics, but overall, is this a big thing that\\'s going to mean that I\\'m going to want to play a better game or that\\'s going to result in a better game? Is this something that I\\'m willing to put thousands of dollars to buy for a high-end hardware gaming PC or whatever new like hardware comes out in order to experience this? >> And my my my honest my honest answer is no. >> Whereas before you buy a new console and you like get such a huge graphical upgrade or get so much more bang for your buck. I I think it it\\'s like any hobby like there are audio files that will be like >> I I need uh I need electricity that\\'s clean like I need you know what I mean like people what do you mean you don\\'t listen in >> I think gaming is like one of the most popular hobbies and for some people like getting every inch out of a PC is like part of the hobby like it is not about does this enhance my game it\\'s can I buy something and like feel like I\\'m getting a lot of value out and this is one of those things Yeah. >> And like it is very impressive when you\\'re playing this, obviously it\\'s a still image, so you\\'re not really getting it, but like it is quite it can be quite compelling at times. And I think although not necessarily improving the game, I think anything that improves the technology and allowing you to make uh certain things more accessible, >> uh someone down the line will find a really cool way to use it, which, you know, I think >> is is like it\\'s like I don\\'t know, like our RPG maker is like, \"Wow, I don\\'t need this. Who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] needs this?\" But then there\\'s like you can make some really [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool things in RPG Maker and tell some really interesting stories. >> Totally. >> Um from this tech that well not necessarily similar and it\\'s a pretty bad argument in comparison, but >> Mhm. >> basically I I think just tech being better and around is good for people to be able to make better things because you never know. >> Oh, no. I I 100% agree with that. It was the point I was trying to make was more about this modern tech vibe where it almost seems like >> sometimes from my perspective you know that\\'s this is just like one example from my expect from uh my perspective a lot of new tech innovations it almost seems like a buzzword as opposed to an actual innovation >> that uh >> that it used to feel like where you you\\'d have something And it literally seemed like something [\\xa0__\\xa0] gamechanging. >> Yeah. >> Have you seen the press conference where Steve Jobs uh announced the first iPhone? >> Yeah. >> God, like >> the amount of [\\xa0__\\xa0] video essays that reference this. >> This is going to be like this is like [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> I haven\\'t seen this, so you\\'re going to have to explain to me. >> No, just like the [\\xa0__\\xa0] just imagine being there when he announced the iPhone. like it was you were there witnessing history being made of something that was like genuinely genuine life-changing tech. There was nothing like this. >> There was nothing like this. And then you go to like modern Apple where where they >> the same [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing every year. >> Yeah. Where they release the same function the where they uh keep us keep functionality from us and then introduce functionality that was available 5 years ago and you\\'re like damn. >> Yeah. The new innovation in Apple is like we got rid of the lightning cable, guys. I know. Crazy. >> And they were kind of forced to. >> Yeah, they were. >> I\\'m glad they did. >> But like I think your Yeah, your quality of life is worse. But I mean, some tech is good that it\\'s >> some tech is good. I\\'m not saying all tech is like that. But I\\'m saying generally in this case of just like 2025 versus 2005, damn tech was just tech was just good and exciting. But then also like I I I think of it as like we are very healthy and able people and I imagine that like if we pose the same question to someone who maybe has a lot more who\\'s maybe more introverted or maybe has some disabilities like tech now is >> so [\\xa0__\\xa0] infinitely better, right? Cuz like it allows them to like actually live and to a world that they didn\\'t have access to. >> Yeah. And so it it is kind of like god damn like I just wish these companies would stop being shitty but that\\'s never going to happen. >> That\\'s never going to happen. It\\'s not the tech itself. It is it\\'s the people making the tech >> guys. It\\'s uh corporations >> down the corporation. >> Okay. Let\\'s say you\\'re you\\'re the age you are now. Would you rather be in this tech or old tech? I think I\\'d still rather be in this tech. >> What do you mean? >> Like I look back fondly on 2005, but I don\\'t think I\\'d want to live in 2005 tech. today. >> Yeah. >> I don\\'t know. I think we\\'re genuinely getting to a point where we, you know, there are trends starting where people are trying to get less tech. Uh we\\'re trying to live with less tech just because we have >> uh >> this whole idea of like less screen time in your day, right? >> We have identified how unhealthy it has become. It used to be that the internet was an escape from the real world and now the real world is an escape from the internet. Um, I don\\'t actually, maybe this is me old man shouting at cloud. I don\\'t actually think we need exactly all of the tech we are so addicted to. Some of it, as you said, very very important, >> but a lot of it is just, >> you know, I seem >> it\\'s space to fill boredom. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> That\\'s what it\\'s become. >> Yeah. I uh when I was in America, I needed I needed headphones and I I door dashed headphones. I didn\\'t have time door headphones >> because I I had to go in 1 hour. I did not have time to go to the store and I needed this and I I I was like I door dashed headphones >> and so I they\\'re like 200 I have them right here actually. >> I have these ones. They\\'re like the the the ones that like go on like the bone. >> Not sponsored by the way. >> No, it\\'s not. They\\'re really [\\xa0__\\xa0] good though. Um, and I was looking at them anyway and I I needed to get them uh cuz I didn\\'t have the the the headphones I needed to do the like IRL live streaming and I door dashed them and it was like so the headphones are 200 bucks. I had a tip like 8% and then t it came to like 250 bucks. >> Yeah. >> And then on the on the way on the way to to me you get the notification like hey do you want to get a coffee as well? I was like a sure why not. Yeah I\\'ll [\\xa0__\\xa0] throw in a coffee. So, I threw in a coffee. Uh, and it was a coffee that was like 100, no, it was like 400 meters away from me. >> Easily could have walked it, but they\\'re like, \"Do you want to get it?\" I was like, \"Yeah, [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. It\\'s free. Why not?\" I threw it on. So, I got the coffee, too. And when I when I arrived, I felt so degenerate cuz he delivered the headphones and he\\'s like, \"All right, I\\'m I\\'m going to go get your coffee now.\" I was like, \"Oh.\" I thought it was like on the way. I didn\\'t. So he went back, got the coffee, came back, and then I was like, now I feel degenerate. >> Yeah. >> Like I should have just walked to get the coffee. And quite frankly, I never should have had the option to be able to do this in the first place. I feel like >> I didn\\'t even know that was an option. >> Yeah. I didn\\'t know. But in the same time, I was like, this is awesome that I could get this headphones in an emergency. Like I needed it in an hour and I got it. >> Mhm. >> But at the same time, something felt so like decadent about being able to do that. >> Yeah. >> And being able to like spend that money to get this. It felt weird. Everything about it felt I didn\\'t and the fact that I could be like I get a coffee for free on us too. I was like this is all so weird. Like everything about this feels wrong. >> And I can\\'t I can\\'t articulate why I feel like this is wrong cuz I\\'m not smart. But >> I think maybe someone can articulate >> with all the modern convenience of modern tech cuz it is a lot more convenient now to live in these times. I can\\'t deny that. >> Are you happier? Are you happy with the convenience you have? >> Oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> I think I I think so. You think so? >> I I think I mean for me I I saved my [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass that I could do that. Otherwise, I would have had to like panic drive >> Yeah. >> to Best Buy to do this and said someone else drove to Best Buy and then brought it to my house and I quite frankly didn\\'t want to do that. >> Um so I don\\'t know. I think I\\'m happier. But I think this comes from I I feel like I have the self-control to be able to decide when I\\'ve had enough. >> But I don\\'t know if everyone has that. >> No, everyone doesn\\'t have like it took like just the [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh you know the will of gods just to uninstall like X Twitter on my phone even though I know I know how [\\xa0__\\xa0] unhealthy that is. And why did it take so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] effort to do that, you know? And >> well, maybe it\\'s because our jobs are more reliant on >> also also like push notifications. I [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate that. >> Yeah, >> BBC News, right? I get it. It\\'s important. But what they classify as breaking news. >> Yeah. >> Don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] send me a push notification for this [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> I I I think only you should like these apps should only be allowed to send me a [\\xa0__\\xa0] notification if it\\'s important. >> Yeah. Do you like short form scrolling content? >> No. >> Yes. And no. >> I get sucked into it. >> Yeah. I don\\'t like it. >> I have to I have to consciously tell myself that I\\'m only doing it for a certain amount of time. I literally put a timer on my phone to be like I\\'m anything longer than this and it\\'s over. >> The fact that I have to be conscious about something means that this is like this is already taking willpower. >> Yes. >> And I\\'m not I\\'m not strong enough. I you know sometimes you go to the toilet, you just scroll and then you get sucked in sometimes. And there are some sessions where you\\'re like, \"Fuck, I feel bad >> after the morning.\" When I wake up in bed, I can\\'t get out of bed for 30 minutes. I\\'m [\\xa0__\\xa0] scrolling like I\\'m more >> unless I\\'m I I\\'m on like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] tight deadline. I got to get out of bed and do some [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> And it\\'s just there\\'s there\\'s so much where I\\'m like, I know this is unhealthy for me, but I still can\\'t stop myself. >> Yeah. >> I\\'ve I\\'ve recently broken that cycle. Not the waking up side of things. I still struggle with that cuz I\\'m I\\'m definitely the person where it\\'s like wake up, turn my alarm off, and then just from there it\\'s such a natural thing of just swipe >> cuz I catch up to all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\'ve I\\'ve cuz you know cuz we we also we live on we work with a lot of people in different time zones. >> Yeah. >> And so I naturally I think we all have messages from people from like America or Australia or the UK. Well, I use stream management, but like UK, so I\\'m always catching up to something. >> Yeah. >> But I have managed to in the past couple of months fixed the whole thing of like when I\\'m going to bed. >> Yeah. >> Like now I\\'m just like, \"All right, at a certain time I\\'m like no more phone. Put that [\\xa0__\\xa0] away. Put on the charger. Put it away. >> Read a book or whatever.\" And then go to bed. And it\\'s been >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] life-changing. So nice. But now I just got to do that for the morning part now, which is way hard cuz I\\'m like, \"Yeah, but like what if someone messaged me while I was asleep and it\\'s important.\" >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> I\\'m pretty bad at reporting. >> So we\\'ll get there one day. >> So yeah, in conclusion, we are um >> 2005 goated technology scary as per usual. >> Technology technology go outside more. I\\'d like to also add, would you prefer to have the current internet um basically speeds and like facilities >> but al but keep the old retro tech like 2005 tech but with current internet speeds? >> Uh I don\\'t know. I It\\'s >> a good question. >> Um >> I think I kind of like the old I think the old suited it well. Yeah. >> And it was a part of its time. >> Yeah. I think it worked well for the speeds that we had cuz it was obviously built around accompanying those speeds. I don\\'t think increasing the internet speed on all this old tech will necessarily make it better or worse. >> Mhm. >> Cuz it\\'s a product of its time. And for half of these things like like the iPod, like the CRT, you didn\\'t even need internet. You could just [\\xa0__\\xa0] use it, you know? >> Fair enough. Should we see the next thing? Is it going to be movies or TV shows? There. Oh, anime. >> Oh, it\\'s anime. >> Okay. Why is Jim on 2005? >> It is not 2005. That show was made in the 70s. >> Uh, okay. That\\'s >> Let\\'s write down our answers. >> Oh god. God, I hope we do different answers at least for this one. >> This is hard actually. So, anime that came out in 2005 versus anime of today. >> Mhm. >> Okay. Three, two, one. >> Oh my god. >> We all put the same Wait, I\\'m I\\'m curious to hear why you put 2025, Joey. >> I just think it\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I think like >> Well, yeah, that too. >> That we wouldn\\'t have got that. We wouldn\\'t have got PE. >> We wouldn\\'t have got that in 2005. >> They would be too scared to put that much. I think I think I think anime has gotten better because like the not only has just the audience base for anime gotten larger, but the demand has gotten larger because of that. And therefore there is more pressure on most studios now to just make higher quality products, you know. And I think like regardless of your current taste in like, you know, old versus new or nostalgia or anything like that cuz I\\'m look I\\'m trying to take away my nostalgia cuz clearly I\\'m way more fond of the left side of the screen than I am the right side. But that\\'s not to say that like >> you know I\\'m throwing away the entirety of the right side either. I\\'ve [\\xa0__\\xa0] watched most of these on the right side. So, it\\'s like and they\\'re great and they\\'re a and you know the 2005 stuff. Yes. >> I like how One Piece is both in 2005 2025. >> It\\'s also in the \\'9s as well if you think about it. But like >> but you know I think like just now that because there is a higher demand and more anime is being made. Yes, there is more slop, but there is also >> more good stuff too. and the fact that there is more of a choice now and the fact that the niches now of each shows is more catered to more specific niches rather than broader topics compared to say 2005 or earlier. I think just a makes it easier for you to actually get into the medium to begin with. But b you just get higher quality stuff and there\\'s nothing wrong with higher quality stuff. I mean, look, like if they [\\xa0__\\xa0] animated Dondon back in 2005, I don\\'t think it would have been good as if they made it today or with most of these. Gachaka couldn\\'t be made 2005. >> Yeah. I mean, I think I think the biggest thing I think this would actually be a harder question if it wasn\\'t 2005 versus 2025. it was 20 2000s versus >> I feel like um 2000\\'s anime uh even if it was just 2010\\'s anime versus 2020 anime, that would be a lot harder of a conversation because I think in the 2000s um anime the anime industry was going into was kind of adopting digital animation and I think a lot of the 2000s anime is characterized by you know them figuring out how to make digital animation look good. And so for every banger you got, there were a lot of shows you watch again. You were like, \"Didn\\'t look great. >> Damn, this uh this >> brother, >> what\\'s that?\" >> Yeah. It\\'s kind of the same with TV, right? Like I was watching I\\'ve been re-watching um Peep Show again for like >> Yeah. >> the [\\xa0__\\xa0] 90th time. And uh it it was made when they started filming digitally, but like 720p was the max. >> Yeah. >> And it looks like [\\xa0__\\xa0] today. It does not look good. But then you watch something from 1950s or60s and because they recorded it on film, it looks amazing. Yeah. >> And I think same thing with anime where it\\'s like it unfortunately 2000s early was when they kind of was at that >> like let\\'s talk about uh 2000\\'s anime CGI >> like what little there was on >> Well, you remember Studio Gonzo, Joey? Remember Studio Gonzo CG? >> How could I forget? >> Yes. Um, you know, it\\'s funny funny to you mention this, but you know, one of the big reasons why anime has improved uh is just technology. >> Yeah, >> that\\'s one benefit of technology. >> Technology has uh has given animators more tools. Yeah, I mean there\\'s a lot of tedious tasks in animation that, you know, a lot of technology helps with >> and I I think in general, you know, there are great stories in 2005 and there were trends setters in 2005, but there are also trends setters in 2025 as well. >> Absolutely. >> Um I think it\\'s hard to argue whether the quality of shows in one decade versus another was better or worse because they I mean they they both had [\\xa0__\\xa0] bangers. There are some It depends what you define quality as this is also this this one is also tough because 2025 is obviously more in line with current tastes and we\\'re probably into. >> Yeah. >> Whereas 2005 I mean I I I was like nine and only a handful of anime I look back really really fondly on. >> Um and so >> what what do you mean? >> Like obviously even if I don\\'t think Dan is my favorite show >> there\\'s a lot that I vibe with in the show. It\\'s very current. It feels very up to date and I think that\\'s fun >> and that\\'s very that makes it very easy to consume and enjoy. >> Whereas, you know, some of these older ones uh other than like Samurai Shampoo >> uh I might have a harder time [\\xa0__\\xa0] with it like uh Mushi Mushi >> like it\\'s a little slower. It\\'s a little like product of its time. And it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not amazing. It just means that like you know at the time when it came out there\\'s a different audience. >> The tastes are different. >> The the tastes have changed. And I think that\\'s also why I picked 2025. >> But I\\'m a victim of my my time. And I\\'m sure that when I\\'m, you know, 20 45, I probably won\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] with the anime coming out cuz I\\'m going to be old as [\\xa0__\\xa0] Like I I probably [\\xa0__\\xa0] with this stuff cuz it\\'s more in line with my age group now. >> Yeah. Also, I think a lot of people forget that like, and clearly they have like rose tinted glasses on when they look back at like 2000\\'s anime. And I\\'m also this as well. Yeah. a lot of the great shows out there that people remember fondly like just don\\'t really look that good. And in in terms of like the actual quality of animation as well, like bro, >> you ever go back to like I know this is like before 2005, you ever go back to like the first season of Pokémon that we all grew up watching? >> Dog, it\\'s a [\\xa0__\\xa0] PowerPoint. >> It\\'s it\\'s like genuinely like bad in some episodes. Whereas you look at like modern Pokémon anime, it\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] insane. Yeah, >> I\\'m like, \"Oh my god, these guys are actually moving. It\\'s crazy.\" >> I do think there was a rounchiness to some stories, but I did get turned down by the 2005. >> Well, there was there was rounchiness because they were coming off of the \\'90s OVA era where there was just no holds barred, but this was around the time where anime was getting really commercialized. >> Yeah. I would say that 2025 >> awkward time for anime. >> It It is. And I I would say that 2025 unlike let\\'s say like the \\'9s and \\' 80s which had their own vibes, 2005 or just mid2000s anime in general is kind of like everything that was started in this era I think has gotten refined into the modern era. Whereas whereas, you know, there are some eras before where, you know, you had like the [\\xa0__\\xa0] OVA era where it was going back to those era. >> It just felt totally [\\xa0__\\xa0] different in a lot of senses, especially with, you know, >> very distinct. >> Yeah. You look at uh \\'90s fantasy and it\\'s so such a different vibe to like everything post 2000 fantasy cuz then you started the whole isekai trend and you know instead of getting transported to a world and people trying to get back to the original world it\\'s more about the escapism of going to another world and staying in that other world and >> being a [\\xa0__\\xa0] gigad or whatever and farming. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I So yeah, I would say this would be a much tougher question. if it was any other era than the mid2000s era because I do think that this was an era there are [\\xa0__\\xa0] bangers in this era. Holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is the era that got me into anime. But it was an era looking back on it where anime started to refind its footing and has grown into where anime is today. >> It was trying to rediscover itself after the experimental phase of the \\'90s, I feel. And I think up until this time it again as G said it hadn\\'t quite gotten its foot in the door yet. >> Yeah. Cuz if it was like 2010 versus 2025 I probably go 2010. >> Yeah. >> I would definitely say so. Yeah. 2010 was definitely around the time where I was like, \"Okay, now we actually understand what anime is and where it\\'s going to go.\" >> I think that\\'s when I think of like anime as the modern sense of it. >> Definitely the code Death Note. That\\'s when I feel like an well even though death is like 2009 but like that\\'s when it became like anime like the modern anime fandom that we all know. >> I I I would say definite was actually 2007 actually. >> Oh my gosh. >> Yeah. >> Um but I would say that you know a lot of the bangers that we talk about in the 2000s come towards more towards like the end of 2000. >> 07 to like 010. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I\\'d say so. >> Okay. uh >> early 2000s anime. There\\'s a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] awkward shows that is very as much as I have a soft spot for them cuz I grew up with them is very awkward to recommend today. >> Yeah. >> You know where cuz it\\'s like it\\'s just like the show didn\\'t really know what it was doing or just it was definitely just a product of its time cuz like you know I feel like >> just media not just anime but like just media in general and music is definitely the same thing which I\\'m sure we\\'ll get to eventually. the 2000s, most people didn\\'t really know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] they wanted to do. >> Yeah, >> they were still trying to come off of the \\'90s, you know, identity of like this is what it is currently. And then when the century rolled over, people were like, \"Yeah, but is it though?\" I don\\'t know. Maybe we should, you know, [\\xa0__\\xa0] around and figure out what we\\'re trying to do. And this was I mean, I love the fact as well, by the way, that half of these shows on the left aren\\'t from 2005 at all. Yeah, it\\'s kind of weird that >> like four of those are from the \\'90s. So, >> yeah, that is weird. Oh, well, I mean, look, we >> But we get the point. Yeah. >> Yeah. All right.

It\\'s unfortunate because I think this year in particular has been really [\\xa0__\\xa0] for movies. Um, but last year was pretty good. Yeah, Dune 2 was last year. I really Damn, this is tough. Um, this is unfair cuz I feel like I would have done different things for movies and TV. >> But you know what? I\\'ll just go in the middle here and I\\'ll do this. Are we all going to have the same answers for everything? I wonder. >> Okay. >> All ready. 3 2 1. >> I said five. >> I I literally went down the middle. Uh because I did have a different answer. >> Okay. I would have done that\\'s what I would have done. >> Yeah. >> So G did 2025 for TV and 2005 for movies. Joey did 2005. >> I didn\\'t know that was an option. Gone. >> I just made that an option because it was movies and I agree. I think movies this year not that great. Um, and and >> K-pop Demon Hunters shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. >> K Demon Hunters just became Netflix most successful thing. >> Yeah. Ever. >> I\\'m not even surprised. >> And I\\'m happy. >> I\\'m [\\xa0__\\xa0] K-pop Demon Hunters, unironically is one of the most exciting things to happen in the modern movie industry for a long time because it\\'s it\\'s something that\\'s not a [\\xa0__\\xa0] sequel or a remake. It\\'s a modern IP. It\\'s actually a new thing >> that is new and I totally >> don\\'t it doesn\\'t vibe with me but I 100% respect it and support it >> all the way. So I think when we talk about gaming we were very fortunate where we got to see a good chunk of uh the later part of early gaming and we got to experience you know PlayStation one which is probably >> you know like SNES >> uh is when you know they started to really like refine gaming I think we didn\\'t have to go through the Atari slop days and all these other confus like Commodore even though I know there\\'s some classics there you know we didn\\'t we we didn\\'t grow up with that which I think is very fortunate cuz we kind of got the tail end of early gaming that started it to be really good and really fun. >> Uh whereas movies, >> movies have been around for a very long time and the idea of a blockbuster has been around before we were born. >> Um and so I think >> film as a medium as we\\'ve known it has not changed an an incredible amount in the like in comparison to gaming. Um, so I think going into this discussion and thinking about movies in that sense then uh is interesting from because gaming has just changed so much and now is kind of becoming a bit more like the same over the past like games from 2025 not crazy different from 2015 other than like live service but you know movies we can we can tell and I think movies >> in 2005 [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing. >> Oh yeah. Um, we\\'ve had a lot of shitty movies lately, but mainly I think this is due to because movies are extremely expensive and there\\'s not a lot of avenues for movies to make money >> outside of streaming. >> Yes. >> Like I mean the fact that K-pop Demon Hunters was straight to Netflix. >> Like that\\'s crazy. Yeah. Happy Gilmore, too. Straight to Netflix. Uh, the only >> I didn\\'t even know they made a Happy Gilmore 2. >> No, >> it was bad. I watched it. >> Yeah, I bet. Why would why would why did anybody think that Happy Gilmore 2 might >> potentially, >> you know, it was like it was a full nostalgia bit movie and it\\'s fine cuz I don\\'t >> if that\\'s the case, just go watch the first movie. >> Yeah. Look, I don\\'t I don\\'t care cuz Adam Sandler seems to have fun and makes movies and whatnot, >> but like Jurassic World, I mean, no one should be forced to watch that film. What\\'s that like man Scorsesei like quote again where he was like he hates the fact that like nowadays like cinema is just a bunch of people getting into tight costumes and acting in front of a green screen. >> No, he didn\\'t say it was it was like modern blockbusters are a roller coaster or something. >> That\\'s right. It\\'s like a theme park. >> Like a theme park. >> Yeah. like it\\'s all about >> that completely wrong but >> yeah or something like that whereas like it\\'s all about like the thrills and like the the excitement of a film but there\\'s no actual like emotional depth and like I kind of half agree with that because you know there\\'s like lots of like say independent films that are being made >> which you know still definitely are cinema and are great but you go to like the cinemas now and it\\'s like every other movie is just like oh okay here\\'s a bunch of famous actors in front of a green screen all right cool Uh yeah. Yeah. I mean I I I mean I like F1 the movie a lot. I watched that. That was a very good movie. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I wouldn\\'t say I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s a bunch of actors in front of a green screen. It\\'s more of just um you to me modern blockbusters are feels very very sy. You know >> they have to be safe. >> Yeah. They have to be safe. It\\'s it\\'s not about getting a midsize movie and making a lot of profit off of that. It\\'s about taking big budgets and making a big summer blockbuster. But also what that means is that you tick off a lot of the same [\\xa0__\\xa0] boxes all the time to appeal to as wide of an audience as you possibly can. >> Yeah. No, certainly. >> Um >> because there\\'s no way in hell, for example, that like if Sin City came out in 2025 that it would have any [\\xa0__\\xa0] attention. >> Yeah. I mean, even like the like American Pie, not that it was a great movie, but like that like you know, and um Superb Bad, like these types of films just wouldn\\'t be made. >> Oh, dude. The whole concept of comedy films is dead now. >> Yeah. Like there >> there are no comedy films anymore >> because they would make money through VHS or DVD sales and, you know, whatever, you know, rentals, whatever. And all the revenue for making movies is gone. Like it is you can only make it from it performing well on streaming services, which doesn\\'t make much or >> Yeah. uh movie tickets, which you have to sell so many to make your money back now that it is it [\\xa0__\\xa0] sucks. >> Yeah. >> Um and you know, even though Superman was a good film, >> I think that the genre is just very stale and overdone at this point where a lot of people feel quite burned by it, me included. >> Yeah. >> I\\'ve complained numerous times about this on the show. >> I think we all have [\\xa0__\\xa0] sick of superhero movies, dude. >> And I say that, but then there\\'s like [\\xa0__\\xa0] Batman here, which superhero movie, and then obviously Harry Potter and and I remember there was this there was this conversation about superhero fatigue all the way back in 2005 >> when uh Spider-Man came out, Batman, the whole Batman trilogy came out. People were already talking about this 20 years ago >> and it\\'s only gotten and now it\\'s only gotten worse. >> Yeah. But that being said, on the flip side, yeah, TV, I think, is more interesting and almost better than it\\'s ever been. I literally have no opinion because I just don\\'t really watch TV shows >> and I never really did back in the day either. So, I\\'m only specifically talking about movies. >> I\\'ve been watching the Alien Earth >> show and that\\'s really good. It\\'s the like a a series from the Alien franchise. >> Really [\\xa0__\\xa0] interesting. Really well done >> and like super interesting. Even though that is a very old franchise, it\\'s it\\'s a franchise that I quite like. The Alien War is so cool. >> Yeah. Uh, >> I just like the fact that TV series nowadays don\\'t need to have like >> 15 seasons of 24 episodes per season run to just >> tell a just tell tell a story. >> You know what I like about what I like about TV series nowadays is that it\\'s become not only a lot more digestible but also just a lot more condensed and I think generally higher quality, you know. Um, you don\\'t really get the I I was I remember I I\\'ve been recommended clips of like Dexter again recently and I I enjoy every TV show back in the day is characterized by Oh, yeah. Like I enjoy the first two seasons of that and they just fell off, right? >> Like Lost. Yeah. I I enjoy like the first few seasons and then I just stopped watching. Um and I feel like nowadays it\\'s more of just yo, every season gets better and better and then it ends. >> Yeah. They don\\'t say they\\'re >> welcome and that\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and I love that >> and that\\'s the way I think it should be rather than TV series getting renewed just because of the fact that it\\'s popular not because >> Yeah. I mean there was less you know less TV in general and you were competing against less and now you have to compete against so many things. >> Yeah. >> So it is better but then sometimes you have to wait like 5 years between seasons now and you\\'re like god damn it. >> I\\'d rather wait five years for seasons. Yeah. >> For some of the quality that we\\'re getting you know. Yeah. >> Uh, I don\\'t want to wait 5 years. I\\'ll be honest with you. I like if seance took him like if if I have to wait that long again for another season, I\\'m probably just going to not care anymore. >> I I it\\' be a decade in my life for what is an equivalent of like 10 hours of TV. >> Yeah. This is why I never got into TV shows. >> Like it is I think it is a valid argument to be like it is taking too long for some shows. uh like House of the Dragon >> loved season 1 took so long for season two and not much happened and that\\'s because of the the style of show. >> Yeah. >> But that I feel like that should have been a factor in consideration when making the show like look >> season 2 is going to be a lot of buildup. We should probably plan around shooting these back to back. Let\\'s make the preparations. Obviously that\\'s that\\'s a risk that some studios aren\\'t willing to take. >> But then what ends up happening is that people just don\\'t give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] anymore because they\\'ve already moved on. They\\'re already on to the next thing. It\\'s not in their minds anymore. I think the the there I think it\\'s a legitimate complaint. I don\\'t think it\\'s a conitment. I think it\\'s like when you take too long between certain things, you often don\\'t have the the fan power to stick around the same way a Star Wars might. Um well, I would argue that >> but I agree quality is best. >> Yeah, we you know, obviously quality is great. Obviously, I\\'m of the philosophy of I will wait for as long as needs be to get a good quality product. Um, we live in an age where information is as easy to get as ever. If you really want >> if if it was that good of a quality that\\'s, you know, the hype might have died down, but let\\'s take severance for example. You know, I still really enjoyed a lot of the second season and it didn\\'t take me too long to catch up. All you needed to do was just watch some [\\xa0__\\xa0] recap videos and uh there you\\'re caught up to >> Yeah, but what if I don\\'t want to watch the recap? >> I also wish that if a season takes more than 3 years for the next season to come out. I think it should be mandatory and law that you have a little mini recap before you start the first episode done by the show. I need them to tell me. >> There are some shows that do that >> and I I [\\xa0__\\xa0] love it when they do that. >> I\\'m pretty sure Seance did that. >> I think Seance did. But ReZero, those [\\xa0__\\xa0] they needed a recap. I had to go to YouTube. I had to pause the first episode. I mean, I was like, I got to watch a recap. >> U I felt like they should have done it. >> Uh but but I think there is a the sad truth of of of people is that even if it takes 5 years to make the show absolutely perfect. >> Mhm. >> If you are missing that hype, you know, sometimes that results in less people watching. And if that happens, maybe there\\'s just not enough money or interest to fund the next season of that would have been perfect show. And so I do think there is this real real concern that you do have to kind of keep all your audiences engaged if you\\'re keeping them on for a, you know, a rhyme. >> So we\\'re talking about the business side of things now. >> But no, but I\\'m saying like obviously in an ideal world, I would love for the show to be perfect and if it takes 5 years, it takes 5 years. But I I\\'m a consumer and even you know I\\'m telling you that like after three five years I struggle to remember much about Severance. I still really wanted to watch it because it\\'s one of my favorite TV shows when it came out. >> Even after 5 years I was like man I kind of feel like I\\'ve moved on a little bit but I was super pumped to jump back into it. >> But I\\'m sure there were a lot of people who didn\\'t really care to. >> I don\\'t know. >> And so that that\\'s a real problem that you have to think about when you are a TV show. >> It it it is a real problem that you have to think about. I 100% agree with that. But that is less to do with you know the quality of the TV show itself because for me there has been I I am of the philosophy of I don\\'t need to watch something unless I feel like watching it. Some people they\\'re like this is the hot thing right now. I need to watch or play or read this whole thing right now. Um, but I, you know, I feel like there\\'s been a lot of shows that I have lost the hype on and then I\\'m like, I wake up one day and I\\'m like, I feel like watching this thing right now. But also, I think a really important aspect of this is that when when you say like, okay, it takes 5 years to make it. I don\\'t think it takes 5 years to make it because they\\'re taking more time to cook. I think it takes longer because the business aspect of it is more [\\xa0__\\xa0] Like I think these studios are not comfortable greenlighting multiple seasons. I think >> maybe there\\'s too many big names involved. Scheduling becomes messy. I don\\'t think it takes longer because it takes longer. I think it takes longer because management of projects is worse and money is so tight with these companies that it becomes a shitty thing where we have to wait until the entire season is done before we greenlight the next season, which then takes a long time because maybe the same people who worked on it aren\\'t available anymore because they need work. So I think like I don\\'t think like severance took as long as it did because that\\'s how long it took. I think it like Ben Stiller wasn\\'t as available to write. I mean that\\'s like a thing you can read like it\\'s admitted like Ben Stiller is too busy. >> Well I I think it was more I I think it comes down to more of just like when you have a pilot season. >> Yeah. it\\'s that you only get the pilot season cuz I\\'ve seen a lot of examples where the the gap between season one and two is [\\xa0__\\xa0] massive and then it gets like okay here\\'s here\\'s a regular thing because now they have like data to >> prove that that >> it has longevity. >> He has longevity. Um, and you you know you sometimes you have examples like Attack on Titan where initially the hype isn\\'t as big but as as the momentum catches back up. >> But that is rare though. That is very rare. >> That is rare. >> I feel like that is not >> not every longunning series can hit that. But I\\'m sure they\\'re all striving for that but they\\'re not. >> Sometimes shows do come back after that that cult classic. >> Yeah. But not everyone has come back on board or maybe some people are not like you know it stuff like this happens. Um >> because you know like Beetlejuice you know that movie and maybe this is a bad example but like you know uh they had the his name plays Beetlejuice uh >> Kevin not Kevin what\\'s his name? >> He played Batman. Um he played so many other characters. >> Oh my god. You know how Yeah, you know what I\\'m talking about. >> The main guy who plays Beetlejuice >> and Tim Burton obviously came back, but it just wasn\\'t very good. But I mean that that wasn\\'t a show that needed a season two or a second movie, but like there like just because you then even bring on the same people doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s going to have the same magic. Yeah. >> You know, so I I feel like >> it\\'s Yeah, it\\'s not so easy. But like Avatar, it\\'s like why is it so [\\xa0__\\xa0] long between Avatar and then they realized, hey, yeah, if we\\'re going to make four [\\xa0__\\xa0] Avatars, we should probably film them all back to back, which he did. And I\\'m glad that they did cuz I would rather I can\\'t imagine a worse thing than be talking about Avatar 2040, >> being part of the franch, you know what I mean? It\\'s just like [\\xa0__\\xa0] ridiculous. >> Um, but obviously it\\'ll come out soon, so cool. I I\\'m I\\'m willing to watch it, but if it was another 10 year wait or I think it\\'s like 15 years or something, I\\'d be like, \"Fuck no, I don\\'t give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about that other stuff.\" I barely gave enough of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] to watch the second one. >> Yeah. I I didn\\'t even watch. >> I just went for cuz I was in I was near a movie theater and I thought, \"Fuck it.\" >> Yeah. >> Like, but that was the thing where I feel like time had most certainly hurt the any chance of season 2 being successful or as successful. >> Wasn\\'t Avatar 2 pretty successful? >> It was pretty successful. >> I don\\'t understand how because I don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] know anyone who gave a [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah. I mean, sometimes hype can die, but sometimes people just go with whatever the hype tells them to go with. >> Exactly. >> Hence Avatar 2, you know. >> Yeah, >> but there are a lot of I mean, there are so many examples for each side here. >> Yeah. >> Uh, but that Harry Potter remake, huh? HBO. >> Sorry, >> the Harry Potter remake for HBO. >> I\\'m so scared for those kids, man. >> You seen this? >> Nope. >> They\\'re remaking. >> How do you do this? How did you not know this stuff? >> Huh? >> They\\'re remaking Harry Potter. How have you not heard about this? What? >> I don\\'t know, man. >> This is crazy. >> Snap\\'s blackmail. >> Oh, that was what all the memes were about. >> That\\'s what that\\'s about. >> HBO is doing a Harry Potter series. >> Oh, John Lithgo is going to be um Dumbledore. >> Dumbledore. >> Okay. >> Um but yeah, most of the casting just seems kind of like, okay, sure. >> Harry Potter. Yeah, there\\'s just an entirely new cast of kids now that are going I assume going to go back to like, you know, Philosopher Stone. Mhm. >> Like first movie, >> but man. >> Yeah. Maybe it\\'s a season the book. >> Yeah. I\\'m sure it\\'s going to be like season one is Philosopher Stone season 2 Chamber of Secrets. >> I\\'m calling now. When they get to like Prison Rascoan, it\\'s going to be like a two-parter and then they\\'re going to make everything a two-parter. >> Of course they are. >> I mean, if it\\'s successful, I\\'m not [\\xa0__\\xa0] of it. >> But John Lithco, I don\\'t know if he\\'ll be around for >> Yeah. Right. >> 20 seasons of Harry Potter. Same thing\\'s going to happen that happened with the first Dumbledore. >> Yeah. >> All right. I mean, sure. >> Yeah. Whatever. >> Yeah. Movies were definitely better 2005. I think it\\'s >> kind of depressing to talk about. >> It is depressing. >> I don\\'t know. I feel depressed talking about it. All right. What\\'s next? >> All right. What\\'s next? >> Oh gosh. >> Food. >> Uh >> food and the way we consume it, I suppose, as well, cuz there\\'s restaurants. It\\'s a hot >> these crappy little whatever. >> I love how the Costco hot dog is on both. Alex knows what\\'s up. The dog never changes. >> And it\\'s even cheaper in Japan. >> It\\'s cheaper in Japan. It is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] cheap in >> I I had one a couple weeks ago and it was [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing. >> You went to Costco a couple weeks. Me, too. >> Yeah. I was like, I have to get the dog. >> I You got to get the dog. >> You got to get the dog. >> You know the the Costco pizza, the slice, I think. Can you Google this? The cheese slice pizza. How many calories you think it is for one slice of pizza in the Costco America? Um, I don\\'t know. It\\'s probably something like [\\xa0__\\xa0] 700 calories, maybe. >> I think it is like 800, 900. >> 760. I\\'m good. But god damn, >> how many how much protein does it have? This also blew my mind. >> If you\\'re bulking, bro. >> Cheese pizza. >> It\\'s got uh 44 g of protein. >> Where Where is the What? From the cheese. >> Jeez. They put so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] cheese on the pizza. You\\'re basically just eating a block of cheese at that point. >> No, you are. You are. It is a block of cheese. >> That\\'s crazy. >> Cuz you eat one slice of pizza. Nearly 800 calories. It\\'s >> like, bro, I\\'m bulking. >> For the cheese pizza. >> All right. Well, next >> 44 g of protein in that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Next time I\\'m at Costco, I got to get bring home a cheese pizza. I\\'m on that bulk right now. >> That\\'s crazy. >> Um [\\xa0__\\xa0] How do you discern this? Okay, first of all, can we all agree that going to Pizza Hut in the early 2000s was so [\\xa0__\\xa0] hard. >> Oh, man. >> On arrival. >> I think >> Yeah, I think eating food as a family, we got to experience the best of it. >> Oh, yeah. >> When we were around, maybe even before our time slightly was like the hypest and coolest part of being a kid. Like, we talked about this before, but like going to McDonald\\'s. >> Yeah, I was going to say, \"Yo, corporations, let\\'s go.\" >> Yeah, dude. It was sick, dude. It was sick. It was sick, man. >> It was actually goated. >> They before they were Dude, it was so hype. Yeah, they were marketing directly to us, but hey, [\\xa0__\\xa0] It works, man. >> Um, >> yeah. No, food now >> for me. But, >> dude, do we need to discuss this? >> It\\'s uh >> it\\'s >> I mean, it\\'s hard to argue. >> Yeah, [Music] >> I think you can just speak on behalf. >> Yeah, we all agree. >> This is not much of a discussion. Um, I think look, there was not a lot of nutritional information around back then and a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] that was in this food that would not be legal in in Europe. >> Yeah, >> America is probably still fine, but >> a lot of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> is pretty ass. >> Yeah, >> if you try it now, you realize why it got left to the side. >> Oh, yeah. >> God, food has just never been better. God [\\xa0__\\xa0] damn. >> It\\'s just evolved in a great way. >> I mean, we can try food from all over the world. all over the world. Like we live in a time where you can >> you can have like every type of cuisine, you know, if you live in certain parts of the world, you can try everything. Even if you don\\'t, you can still >> even in rural areas, there are still a lot more choice of just different foods. Whereas before, where I was growing up, you eat rice and people look at you like you\\'re a [\\xa0__\\xa0] psychopath. But now you can go to even in the UK which is not known for food but you can go to the supermarket and get ready meals that are Indian food, Chinese food. >> Also there\\'s just so much more like dietary options as well for people who you know need to be on like certain dietary options. It was so hard to you know back in 2005 to find >> easier watching what you\\'re reading. There\\'s a lot more information and also the ability to share information with other people. >> Uh people keeping track online, you know, there\\'s a lot more. I will say that\\'s the one good thing about like Tik Toks and shorts is that I found some great [\\xa0__\\xa0] recipes from it. >> Dude, someone so hard to find back in a much better chef as well because of the resources that are available. >> Yeah, because in 2005 the only way you\\'d be able to find a new recipe is if you like bought like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cookbook, which >> you didn\\'t know what it looked like >> and you didn\\'t know what it looked like. And like today, no one [\\xa0__\\xa0] buys cookbooks anymore because you don\\'t need to. >> Like that that like mac and cheese kid cuisine thing in the bottom middle. >> That\\'s insane. You know that [\\xa0__\\xa0] would taste disgusting. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> So yeah, easily 2025. I don\\'t think there needs to be much discussion around. >> Yep. >> Yeah. Toys. >> Toys. Oh wow. >> Oh >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] This is tough. >> This is tough. >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] Why do they put Mr. Beast Lab swarms in there? Like bro. Um, >> you know, this is tough cuz obviously we don\\'t use toys. >> Yes. I think though the argument can maybe be said. I mean, I think we can all agree 2005 was just better because we were kids. Well, I mean, >> but in saying that, I will say 2025 there have also been this trend of kids of toys, excuse me, that have been catered towards more of an adult fan base that clearly is like banking on the nostalgia. Say for instance, Lego is like, you know, back in 2005, there were very little Lego sets or anything like that or even just the culture of creating Lego as an adult, whereas now it\\'s very much normalized and Lego has fully leaned into that [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they\\'re like, \"Yep, these are sets for adults now.\" >> All right, I got it. >> But yeah, I think we can all agree it\\'s this. All right, ready? Yeah. >> 3 2 1 >> 05. >> Yeah, 05. >> I I saw Bionicle and I was like, >> do toys even exist anymore? say like, \"Yeah, >> toys for kids.\" >> Have you Have you walked into >> I think the age upon which you stop playing with toys is a lot sooner now. >> Yes. >> I think I\\'m I\\'m like most of the toys I see, they\\'re not even marketed towards kids anymore. >> That\\'s the thing. That\\'s the thing. Lego now is an adult hobby. >> Pokémon cards. >> Pokémon cards adult hobby. >> Leoo adult hobby. This it\\'s it\\'s all it\\'s all catering to the nostalgia of kids who grew up in 2005. And like a third of these things on the 2035 are like dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] things from like >> Beyblades. >> Yeah. >> Adult. That\\'s the thing. >> Um Yeah. I mean I think and you also had to make like because toys were I feel like such a bigger market >> in early 2000s. You had to really make some cool toys. >> Absolutely. because we did not have the internet to uh help distract us >> or like Timu [\\xa0__\\xa0] you can get absolutely you can get so much garbage for so cheap now. >> Yeah, >> but like you toys were quite expensive back then. If you were to buy one of these things like it had to kind of be good. >> How many of those on the left did you have? >> I had I never unfortunately never got to do Barnacle. >> I had the Bopit. I had Beyblades. I had that robot thing. >> What is that robot thing? >> I had that robot thing and I had the eye dog, I think. >> Oh, really? >> Yeah. I had the Razor scooter. >> I had the Razer scooter. >> I had the Razer scooter as well. >> Many Ashin were some of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] expensive, man. Some of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is expensive, >> dude. I remember my friend had the moon shoes and I was so jealous. >> And then when I actually tried it, I was like, this is kind of ass. >> Well, I had a trampoline, which was way better. >> Same. >> Uh, but what is this [\\xa0__\\xa0] man? Like that that Lego thing is not for kids. That\\'s for an adult. No, I in fact I was very close to buying boooos on here >> cuz it is a toy. >> I\\'ve never seen a kid have a Le Boooo before. >> But that\\'s the thing. It\\'s that like toys today now I think more than anything are catered towards adults who grew up as kids 20 years ago and they\\'re banking on the nostalgia because if you think about it, Lubu is just the modernday Furby. >> Uh yeah. You know, there\\'s something about a Laboo that makes me so sad. >> Why? Why is that? Like there\\'s just something that like it kind of embodies like hyper consumerism and trends to like such a degree that is like so depressing cuz like you only care about the Laboo because other people care about the Laboo. >> Yeah. >> Like there\\'s no way that like it is an earnest thing that you [\\xa0__\\xa0] have fell in love with and it means so much to you cuz you only care about it because it\\'s a trend. And I feel like it is everything wrong with like us and like Tik Tok and advertising. >> Yeah. >> You know, >> no, that\\'s definitely the case. >> Nobody liked Laboo a year ago. Nobody even [\\xa0__\\xa0] heard about it. And and what it doesn\\'t do anything. It just sits there. >> No, but that\\'s the thing. It\\'s the modernday Furby. >> It\\'s the exact same thing. And and I think a lot of the people who are into things like Laboos now and Pop Vinyl toys are the people who grew up with Bratz dolls, Furbies, and stuff like that. And it\\'s tapping soft toys like this fashionable and trendy way. And you know, >> I mean, as a fashion item, I can totally understand. But like people just buy it because hype. I\\'m like, what is wrong with you? >> Oh, yeah. But you can say that about anything. You say that about Pokémon cards. >> It\\'s always been that way. >> I mean, that\\'s more of a speculative thing at this point. I feel like that is like people are trying to do it because of perceived value. >> Well, yeah. Same thing\\'s happening with Laboo as well, you know. >> Yeah. I mean, when I when I when I mentioned that, I was like, \"Yeah, but I mean, I bought Magic cards that were like [\\xa0__\\xa0] expensive.\" >> Yeah, exactly. Right. We\\'re all a victim of it. >> History repeats itself. Laboo is just the latest uh the latest next hot trend, but there will always be another hot trend. Of course, there\\'s always going to be something to replace it because that nostalgia and as long as that generation exists, aka our generation that again grew up with 2005 toys exists, there\\'s always going to be something to replace that. And, you know, I\\'d say like the the whole again trend of Lego finally tapping into, you know, sets for adults is very much that like they understand that nostalgia is such a massive thing. And you know that\\'s not to say that >> also Lego can just make a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ton more money and just sell you more pieces. >> Of course. >> Yeah. >> But I I would >> don\\'t have disposable incomes. >> No, but I would argue that I I don\\'t know the exact details, but as someone who still builds Legos to this day, I very much buy them because it taps into that nostalgic part of me that I want to relive, but in a modern way. And I think toy manufacturers are so good at that now because they understand how powerful nostalgia is. Whereas in 2005, they didn\\'t have to do that. >> I uh when I was in America, I saw uh it was like on the side of the road, like a popup tent that was selling toys. >> Mhm. >> And one of the toys they sold was Italian brain rot toys. >> What? >> Yeah. Let me show you this image. >> I hate those string of words that you just said, by the way. Before I even see the image of it, I already hate it. Look at it. >> And it\\'s like the tongue. >> The [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah. And like the cappuccino ballerina or whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] this thing. >> I knew it was over when I walked into a toy store. >> Yeah. This like tongue tongue [\\xa0__\\xa0] Like look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] man. We\\'re cooked. >> Yeah. I knew it was over the mo the moment I started seeing like [\\xa0__\\xa0] Skippy toilet plushies and stuff like that. I was like it\\'s it\\'s over. It\\'s over for toys. So yeah. >> Yeah. I think I think kids today can even agree that 2005 toys were better. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Like my kid is getting a Razor scooter. No question. >> I Yeah. >> You know. >> Yeah. Isn\\'t that true? >> There was just more innovation back then cuz it was the thing that was actually targeted towards kids. >> Uh yeah. >> You know, >> I don\\'t know why, but you know when someone\\'s like obsessed with like Hello Kitty, seven roll, all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\'m trying to think in my head why I feel like that feels more earnest than uh Laboo\\'s in my head. >> It\\'s the exact same thing. >> I know it is to the extent, but I don\\'t know why. I feel like >> I think it\\'s because trending and you can\\'t escape from it now. >> Le Boooos came out. Oh my god. I just hate saying the word. It just >> maybe because it\\'s like >> it just came up so quickly. >> Yeah, it came out >> quickly and that it it feels like it has no identity. >> No, it definitely does. I think I think you\\'re only I think you\\'re only saying that because when it comes to like say Sunreo characters, they had things like anime, they had things like other cross media stuff to build the law. >> Why like you know when someone\\'s really into anime figures which I guess is the same thing. It\\'s like okay but there\\'s a lot of like connection there to a piece of media which I think when there\\'s >> literally just this thing that has nothing >> just spawned and they\\'re like this is valuable. You\\'re like >> that\\'s the thing if Labou started off as an anime I don\\'t think you\\'d feel the same way. No, I don\\'t think I would because I would think, you know, I would associate you have some sort of, >> you know, you\\'ve maybe built up a connection with that piece of media and it\\'s a lot more understandable, I think. >> But I feel like that\\'s how like our parents felt when they [\\xa0__\\xa0] saw the Furby for the first time. >> They\\'re like, \"What is this shit?\" >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> What is this? It\\'s just a [\\xa0__\\xa0] furball that occasionally makes noises. Like, why am I paying 40 bucks for this [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> All right. You know, well, >> it\\'s all perspective. Next thing. >> Next thing. >> Oh, okay. >> Cartoons. >> 2000s. >> Oh, okay. Now we\\'re going on to the 2000s >> to versus the 2020s. So it\\'s still a 20-year gap, but now it\\'s like a whole >> Ben is still going. >> Yeah, Ben is still very popular. >> Most of these shows are still going. >> Do you know which one is the most popular show gone? Kid show. >> Bluey. >> Yeah, Blueie [\\xa0__\\xa0] runs this world. >> Aussie. >> We\\'re all in Bluey\\'s world. >> Um, okay. >> So 2000s or 2020? This is also so unfair. >> It is unfair. >> One of them I was the age to consume them. >> Like >> that is true. Even though people keep saying like cartoons, you know, aren\\'t just for kids, but man, when you see this lineup >> Yeah. Uh >> I mean, it\\'s the 2000s. Come on. >> Is it? >> Yeah. >> I mean, I\\'ve I\\'ve watched a couple of episodes of Bluey. It\\'s pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] good. >> It is good. Blue is [\\xa0__\\xa0] great. No, I\\'m I\\'m sure it is. And you know, this is coming from someone like I\\'ve seen a couple of episodes of Gumball and I think it\\'s actually pretty solid. >> I Yeah, I think some of these are very kid like whereas some of those are a lot more like early teenager. >> Mhm. >> Like Ed and Eddie. >> Shrek. >> Yeah. Shrek. Shrek is Shrek is an adult movie disguised as a kids. >> Yeah. Cars the Cowardly Dog is a late teenagers disguised as a car cartoon. >> Yes. >> Um >> I mean, I\\'mma be real. I just don\\'t know enough about modern cartoons. >> Yeah. I don\\'t feel comfortable saying older or new, but I know Blueie [\\xa0__\\xa0] hits hard. >> Yeah, Blue is great. >> And I I\\'ve heard from people who have kids, they\\'re like, I [\\xa0__\\xa0] love watching Blue with my kid. >> Yeah. >> Um >> I don\\'t know if my parents never watched any cartoons with me because they didn\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] with any of them. Yeah, >> my dad only watched two cartoons with me. Samurai Jack and Ed and Netti. >> Dude, I wish >> were the only two shows that my dad was like, >> you know what? I [\\xa0__\\xa0] with this heavy. >> I mean, like, look, if Samurai Jack was there, I\\'d put that and there would be no contest. GG. >> That is true. But the new season was also pretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] good. >> It was. And that was very much aimed at adults. I\\'ll just do 2000s. I don\\'t know why I\\'m writing it down. I I mean I I I really don\\'t feel like we can have a good discussion on this one. >> Let\\'s go. >> Yeah. This is purely nostalgia. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> 20 2000s versus 2020s education. Oo, okay. Interesting. >> Dude, I watched this Netflix show. >> Uh-huh. >> It was a movie and it was the most psycho [\\xa0__\\xa0] Can I spoil it for you? Are you because I don\\'t think you do you watch true true crime documentaries on? >> No, not as much anymore. No. Okay, I\\'m gonna spoil this. I don\\'t know what it\\'s called. Um, can I let me quickly check the name before I spoil it for you? >> God, the while you\\'re looking at that, by the way, the [\\xa0__\\xa0] wave of nostalgia the moment I saw that [\\xa0__\\xa0] Microsoft CD. >> Yeah, I know, right? >> Holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] Oh my god. Just >> opening up the dish tray and [\\xa0__\\xa0] putting a CD in. God damn. >> I was at Lewig\\'s house and right before I left, they played this documentary called Unknown Number: The High School Catfish. And apparently it\\'s very popular in America right now. >> Okay. Mhm. and I\\'ll I\\'ll spoil the entire thing for you. So, if you do want to watch this, it\\'s an hour and a half. You can go watch it. >> If you don\\'t really care for true crime, you\\'re not really missing out. >> Um, it was a case where there was a girl and a boyfriend and they\\'d been added to a group chat where someone was just typing the most vulgar [\\xa0__\\xa0] to them, like sending text through burner numbers. >> Okay? >> And it kept happening and the whole time I\\'m watching it, I\\'m like, man, why don\\'t they just like I know it\\'s bad, but why don\\'t you just block this number? and they would block the number and then okay they would they would have a new burner number would add them both to a group chat >> uh and would keep texting them and I was like why don\\'t they just change their phone number they didn\\'t change their phone number until 2 years of this harassment >> okay >> so for 2 years they let this harassment go on >> uh this person texting them multiple times a day >> harassing them saying absolutely heinous [\\xa0__\\xa0] to these like 12-year-olds uh and it was always about this one guy who was like he was like a 13year-old or something and he was like this [\\xa0__\\xa0] doesn\\'t love you, she won\\'t give you [\\xa0__\\xa0] and [\\xa0__\\xa0] like daily. >> Okay. >> Uh and then she\\'ll be like, \"Wow, you really [\\xa0__\\xa0] sucked at basketball. I saw you got no points today.\" So, they were all like very personal, too. >> So, whoever was harassing them, >> they knew this person, right? >> Knew not knew this person, but was in school with them cuz they had information to things that were in school with them. >> Um, and this went on for like ages and they couldn\\'t figure out who was doing it. But it was starting to affect relationships. And it got really weird when um they had broken up these two people cuz he finally couldn\\'t take it anymore that they this person was doing this and and harassing them. Um and then the boy who was getting harassed was dating a girl in like a state over uh and somehow got both their numbers out of them to a group chat and started harassing them again. And like that was like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is going on? How the hell do I get these numbers? It turned out the person who was doing it was the parent of the girl who was dating the the kid >> originally, >> okay, >> who was sending these messages being like, \"You\\'re a [\\xa0__\\xa0] You\\'re a piece of shit.\" It was the mom who was sending it to her daughter in a group chat with this other guy. >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah. Un [\\xa0__\\xa0] unhinged. They found it out cuz they did like VPN traces on like the service that she was using to make these numbers. >> And she was doing this for 2 years. >> Like absolutely harassing her daughter. Uh >> why? >> The the prevailing theory was it was um I think it\\'s like a thing called like Munchhousen thing where it\\'s like >> Oh yeah. >> You would you would but normally this would be you would make your kids sick. >> Yeah. >> To make them need you. >> Oh, I see. >> You said they the theory was that like she wanted the daughter to Wana >> to be like reliant on >> cuz then she\\'d be crying all day and be like, \"Mom, no.\" >> I see. I see. >> And then also then they thought that she was kind of obsessed with this boy >> who was like a kid, >> right? was taking the attention away from the mother. >> Yeah, it was all [\\xa0__\\xa0] very weird. And the whole time I was singing this, I was like psychotic. >> I was like, >> \"This [\\xa0__\\xa0] you couldn\\'t do this [\\xa0__\\xa0] back then.\" >> No. >> Hell no. That would have been way too You can\\'t get burner numbers that easily or like readily available for like on a service. And I was just watching it. I was like, >> man, it must [\\xa0__\\xa0] suck to be a kid nowadays having to you can you can have this happen to you. >> Yeah. >> And now AI is in the mix. >> Oh my god. Oh, it\\'s GG\\'s. >> I\\'m like, it\\'s so cured. [Music] >> Um, yeah, learning [\\xa0__\\xa0] sucks now. It seems >> I just feel bad for that generation of kids who had to go through school during the pandemic and the whole Zoom classroom [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Oh, they lost two years though. >> I can\\'t I couldn\\'t imagine going through that. And I you know, obviously it\\'s not it\\'s not the fault of the kids or the education system. >> [\\xa0__\\xa0] the kids. >> Yeah, [\\xa0__\\xa0] them kids. Okay. No, I mean obviously >> Yeah. No one\\'s at fault. It\\'s just an unfortunate situation. But man, I\\'m I\\'m sure like that really [\\xa0__\\xa0] up the mentality of not just the students who had to go through that [\\xa0__\\xa0] but just like the teachers as well. I can\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] imagine being a teacher during that period. You imagine trying to [\\xa0__\\xa0] It\\'s hard enough to wrangle together a classroom full of kids IRL. Could you imagine trying to do that over a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Zoom call? >> It\\'s impossible. >> No, you It\\'s cooked. >> Yeah. Um, sorry, I did a yogurt. >> That\\'s all right. >> I will say what what is that thing called on the top right of the 2000 site? The thing where it\\'s like the the projector. Is it a projector? >> Yeah, it\\'s a projector. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Paper projector. >> Yeah, they still use that in my school when I was there. >> Oh, really? >> Yeah. You didn\\'t know that? >> Uh, I didn\\'t know they still used it. I thought it was all completely replaced by like the smart whiteboards. Oh, there was some teachers that really liked the projector and being able to >> Oh, yeah, dude. It\\'s a vibe now. >> Um, >> I love that [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah, some people, some of the teachers really liked it and it was still somewhat effective. We used it. I used it even in high school, I think. >> Oh, really? >> Yeah, I still had it. >> Oh, yeah. No, no, I remember using it in high school, definitely. But around like the end of high school for me was when they were slowly being phased out by the smart whiteboard. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, too. But I I I there was one teacher that the our physics teacher, I remember, he really liked the blackboard and didn\\'t want to remove it. M >> and he loved and I also think the blackboard is hyper [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> The blackboard is hyper [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> The blackboard is unrivaled. >> I\\'m so happy that schools in Japan today still use it. >> Yeah, the blackboard. >> I hope they never get rid of that. >> I I the the [\\xa0__\\xa0] projector over there. >> Yeah, I was I was just saying that top the top three on the 2000 side. Actually, that whole 2000 side is just so nostalgic. >> Yeah, I I think >> Oh, the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the CRT on the train. >> Oh, man. That\\'s how you knew when the substitute teacher came in and he pushed that [\\xa0__\\xa0] in and was like, >> \"Oh, we\\'re watching Shrek today.\" >> Yeah, we\\'re watching Shrek today. What\\'s going on? >> Yeah. Also, like is crazy to me and I don\\'t understand why this isn\\'t like banned. Why are phones allowed in school? >> Like in fact, >> like I know that like emergency, but I\\'m like come on. >> Yeah. >> They got your number on file. If there\\'s an emergency, they\\'ll [\\xa0__\\xa0] call you. I think what they should do is they should keep phones uh like school so that you know like parents can call or whatever you know just in case anything happens but turn the internet off. >> I think like you should No, I think you should have to like hand in your phone when you get to school and you get it when you leave. >> Really? >> Yeah. I don\\'t think you should be allowed your phone. >> Like I think there and I also think like you\\'re robbing kids the opportunity to live without their phone >> cuz when they go home they\\'re going to use their phone. >> When they get on the bus they\\'re going to use their phone. I don\\'t understand why you should don\\'t give kids 8 hours where they don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] use their phone. >> Because they\\'re all going to go [\\xa0__\\xa0] insane. That\\'s why. Cuz they\\'re so reliant on it. >> But I I you know, >> I mean, at which age do you think a kid should get a phone? >> Uh 16. I mean, look, I think >> 15 16 if you are, you know, your kid is commuting to school on on their own, I think it\\'s understandable to want them to have a phone to worry about it, especially cuz like certain part like if you\\'re in America, bro, that shit\\'s dangerous as [\\xa0__\\xa0] PvP is on. >> Yeah, >> you need that phone. Um, >> and but like do you need it in school? I don\\'t think so. Like what would you like getting to school? Sure. >> Even flip phone. >> You flip phone? Sure. Yeah. Flip phone too. >> Give him the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Nokia brake phone. >> Yeah. you you shouldn\\'t be able to have this monolith that has all the world\\'s information on it and doesn\\'t challenge you and allows you to be, you know, >> but then they pull out a, you know, Chromebook or whatever and they have to use that anyway. So, I don\\'t know. And like, yes, you need to use and of course you should have laptops in the classroom cuz look, >> I I I resent the fact that they seem to think that like using a calculator was something barbaric in school when it was like, \"Brother, we\\'re going to be using this our entire life. Like, the calculator is not going anywhere. There\\'s a reason why this was invented and it\\'s going to be used and that\\'s why probably in secondary school you had the exam math exams with calculators and without. I don\\'t know if you had that. >> Yes, we had that. >> So like yeah it makes sense, right? But uh so I\\'m not saying like no technology allowed but like I feel like it\\'s crazy that kids are allowed phones in school but I know Australia they\\'re trying to are they banning it or trying to ban? >> I think they\\'re trying to ban it. Yeah. >> It\\'s crazy to me there\\'s parents that don\\'t want this banned. >> Yeah. >> But like is it like helicopter parents? I don\\'t know. might be I\\'m not a parent, so I don\\'t know. I >> It might I mean, I\\'m sure it\\'s a case by case, but I\\'m sure like obviously a lot of helicopter parents are like, \"No, I need to make sure that my child is safe at all times.\" And I\\'m like, >> \"Yeah, but you\\'re in a school. It\\'s supposed to be a safe environment for your child.\" And if you don\\'t think that way, then there\\'s clearly something wrong with either the education system or the school that you put your kid in. >> There\\'s also some like kids doing some dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> Yeah. >> And I don\\'t think they should be I don\\'t think they should be allowed to have pictures. Like the kids will probably think of other kids doing some like, you know, in their probably most vulnerable moments. >> Yeah. >> That will come to haunt them. >> I did some dumbass [\\xa0__\\xa0] in school. And if there was 4K video proof of me doing that, >> yeah, I think I think I would be [\\xa0__\\xa0] depressed. >> I would hate going to school as well. >> Now, obviously, I imagine it sucks because I it\\'s understandable that should teachers have to enforce taking stuff off of kids, >> probably not. That\\'s a whole different job and a kid\\'s going to have their parents responsibility. and kids are playing against smart because they\\'ll have multiple phones multiple phones like there are so many workounds I imagine like it is a losing battle unfortunately but yeah I think it is a a thing that like yeah it sucks but I\\'m not I\\'m not a parent I\\'m not trying to parent but it just just seems like being a kid now is so much harder >> like being able to be a kid and experience like [\\xa0__\\xa0] up learning things just seems hard now >> yeah I don\\'t know I have turned around to this idea where I I think being a kid was always hard in some way, shape or form. >> Yeah, of course it was >> problems problems that we had. uh kids are pretty you know I\\'m sure there is this discussion uh every generation that comes along and at the end of the day I think just it all comes down to parenting style and >> you know whatever >> the environment itself is something that you\\'re not is not always going to be in your control but in terms of just having a good parenting style that teaches your kid, what is important and what isn\\'t important. Imposing your own self rules is >> I think, you know, something that is equally important and something that we should be paying maybe even more attention to. >> Yeah. >> Uh cuz >> at the end of the day, uh you can have the best system in the world, but if you have bad parents, >> that\\'s true. >> Don\\'t give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] The kids uh the kids still going to have a hard time. >> But I just think that good systems help or good systems definitely help, right? Like not that I don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] know what good parenting is. Yeah, I can barely figure it out eventually. >> Yeah, I live off Uber Eats. I can\\'t talk about what is a good parenting or not, right? Like, but >> it just seems hard. It seems hard to be a kid. >> Yeah. And again, you never know like on when and if we have kids that we might [\\xa0__\\xa0] flip our opinions on it, you know? So, we don\\'t know with this, right? But at least as far as we see it and maybe the nostalgia is talking again. Yeah. Just >> it\\'s just like when I see like videos of kids fighting online, like in school, I\\'m like, why am I seeing this? Like why is this a thing that I can see? >> Bro, this this happened to you though. >> Yeah, I fought. But like it wasn\\'t filmed and uploaded. >> It wasn\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] world stock. >> Yeah. Right. Like it that that feels like that is a vulnerable thing and something that it just happens in schools. Like fights are going to happen. >> Mhm. >> I don\\'t think like a kid getting his [\\xa0__\\xa0] ass beat should be uploaded to the internet >> cuz then there\\'ll be like there\\'ll be a caption like this bully gets destroyed and it\\'s like wow. Good for the kid sticking up for himself. Why am I seeing this? >> Yeah, I don\\'t give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I shouldn\\'t see this. This should not be something I\\'m allowed to see. >> Mhm. Yeah. >> I agree. >> Even when I was watching that documentary about this um these school kids, like I don\\'t know how old these kid cuz the kids are in this documentary talking about it. >> I don\\'t know how old these kids are. They seem very very young, >> right? >> And it feels very wrong that these kids who are nearly like 18 or are 18, I don\\'t know, are talking about something that happened in school talking about their classmates. I\\'m like, I just don\\'t think an 18-year-old should be talking about the situation. >> No. >> Like, I feel like this is too fresh and like >> this shouldn\\'t be a problem. >> You know, they have all the the body cam footage that they\\'re showing of it. Not that this is completely unrelated, but again, all this stuff I feel like I shouldn\\'t be seeing this. >> Like, this is stuff that I shouldn\\'t be allowed to see. And and videos from school, I shouldn\\'t be allowed to see on Twitter. >> Yeah. Keep that [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the school. Like I I really really hate the fact that you know it kids are so worried about [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. >> So you\\'re the biggest issue you have isn\\'t with the education system. It\\'s just with social media. >> Social media. >> It goes back to taking the internet. >> Yeah. Because I\\'d be like, \"Yo, hop on Club Penguin when you get home tonight.\" >> That was [\\xa0__\\xa0] fire. It was a safe space. Can\\'t do that [\\xa0__\\xa0] now. Hop on Fortnite. Great. While some guy trying to like get in my DMs, he found out I was 12. I mean, I think the biggest thing kids will are growing up learning is that, you know, anyone can be a star at any time at the in in at the flick of a switch. Sometimes sometimes it\\'s just luck. It\\'s terrifying. >> They don\\'t realize that they have the rest of their life to figure that [\\xa0__\\xa0] out. They think that it needs to happen now during their vulnerable state, during their, >> you know, during the time of their life where they don\\'t even know who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] they are, >> you know? So it\\'s like how do you expect them to like turn that side of the brain off when it\\'s literally in their pocket at all times even in school? >> What was it like it\\'s like Sam Alman he was he said something like he he thinks people are going to get dumber now cuz AI is going to fill in the gaps for a lot of people. >> You think people are going to get dumber now >> cuz they are required to think less. >> It\\'s I feel it\\'s too multi. I\\'m sure like maybe would you argue the same argument could be made if uh when the internet was a thing >> I don\\'t think so cuz I think that enabled a source of information that was not available and there wasn\\'t like you still if you wanted to learn something you still had to go to quite a bit of effort on your own to go through it understand it process the information yeah >> discern right from wrong >> I think knowledge if anything I think I\\'m not sure if dhammer is the right word I think knowledge is going to be more specialized for example like you know to be an engineer you obviously have to understand maths but for the life of me I can\\'t do [\\xa0__\\xa0] mental arithmetic that\\'s a basic skill that\\'s you know long form division I don\\'t know how to do that but I got a masters being able to do like second order differential equations >> yeah yeah me too >> and I think with the age of AI sure people are going to think less maybe for like general knowledge and stuff like that cuz that\\'ll be something that >> um that\\'ll be something that humans can rely on a AI as a tool. But I think in general that just means it gives mental freedom for people to uh focus on more specialized knowledge that can\\'t be done via AI. This is me being optimistic about tech. At least at least >> we\\'ll see. Yeah. Yeah. This is me being optimistic about tech. But uh wait a couple years. I just want I just want to play devil\\'s advocate. >> All right. We\\'ll see. All right. Next up. What\\'s next? Next up. >> All right. 2000s versus 2020\\'s music. >> God, this is >> Hi, Jo. >> This is the most [\\xa0__\\xa0] Alex pick I\\'ve ever seen. >> Um, [\\xa0__\\xa0] man. This is so It\\'s so Look, I listen to Da Punk and Jarquai, so I think it\\'s pretty obvious. >> Yeah, that\\'s just my tastes are going to be. Yeah. >> 90s and 2000s. >> Like 2000s for me. Um, for me, okay, for this, we\\'re not going to delve on this too deeply, obviously, cuz I don\\'t know if you guys have any deep opinions on this at all. >> Uh, beeps and doops. Uh, I actually don\\'t have an opinion. No. >> Yeah. I think we\\'ll keep this short. I think I think neither is better than the other because it completely depends on the genre. Some genre I think pop music is better than it\\'s ever been now. >> Mhm. But you go back to some other stuff like you know say it because again it depends on what you like at the end of the day you know because I feel like okay yeah Kanye West graduation era >> I think everybody can agree is better than the [\\xa0__\\xa0] he\\'s making now >> you know I don\\'t think you even even the most hardcore Kanye fan can tell you that yeah you know what we miss the 2000\\'s Kanye definitely >> yeah but do you think there is a best period of music not 200 thousands versus 2020 20s. Do you think there is a best period of music? >> Depends what you like at the end of the day. Okay. Okay. Let\\'s say >> I feel like rock and roll, there\\'s so many different eras that you could like a lot. Like \\' 60s punk was really [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool, too. >> Yeah. Yeah. If you like say look at like punk music, right? I think most people will tell you that like Yeah. the beginnings of punk like late \\'7s, early \\'8s was definitely where it was the peak, you know? you look at like say metal music like okay it depends which how puritan are you with these different genres right whereas if you\\'re just a general music enjoyer I think 2020s is I would pick 2020s over 2000s because music has just evolved more in those 20 years >> and there is just like more I guess like well maybe like I would almost say like less gatekeepiness in the 2020s than compared to the 2000s. I don\\'t know cuz I I think about this and this is someone this is probably going to be like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] misinformed take as someone who does not know anything about music. >> Um I I I look back at 2000\\'s music and obviously I have major nostalgia over like 2000\\'s music. >> Sure. >> Um because that\\'s the era I grew up in. >> Uh are there songs that I liked as a kid that I think that my kids will listen to and be like, \"Yo, that was a banger song. I don\\'t know. I like Do you think that our kids are going to look back at this era of music in the same way we look back at our parents\\' generation? You know, >> probably. >> Yes. >> You think so? >> I think kids are already starting to do that. I mean, look at the fact that [\\xa0__\\xa0] The Weekend brought back the sound of the 80s. >> Yeah. The Weekend I feel like will be that in like 20, 30 years. >> Yeah. Well, do you do you think like people would listen to [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I don\\'t know Papa Roach or like Ps 41 and be like >> people stopped listening to Papa Roach like 3 years after they broke out. No one [\\xa0__\\xa0] listen like music like that >> but when I hear it it hits different. >> Of course it does. >> Yeah. >> You know, but but that\\'s the thing, right? is that like it completely depends on a what kind of music you even gravitate towards on a personal level, b how much nostalgia music plays because I would say music more than any medium plays on nostalgia more than anything. >> And three, it depends on how open you are to today\\'s music. If you\\'re completely shut off from today\\'s music and you\\'re just like, \"No, anything past like 2010 is all [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I don\\'t care for it because it\\'s new and I\\'m going to stay in my little hug box of the stuff that I grew up with.\" Then yeah, obviously music today is going to suck. But like, >> you know, that [\\xa0__\\xa0] the Snake album there, the new Def Tones album is [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing. The Weekend stuff [\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing. You know, like there\\'s great music coming out today. >> It\\'s just it it all depends on how you even consume the medium to begin with. >> Yeah. Well, okay. Let\\'s talk about I guess the, you know, I I I feel like there was good music if you look out for it. Whatever era, you know, whichever one of these eras. >> Yes. >> What about kind of like pop culture in terms of >> in terms of what songs and what artists are dominating modern like dominated modern culture of that time? >> What do you mean by that? as in um you\\'re saying great music is being made now and I agree with you. Great music is being made now. I think great music is always being made. Um I think when it comes to discussing which era is better, it\\'s more of like discussing what are the artists and songs that defines that era of music. you know, is this >> because obviously each era, each decade has different vibes and different artists that kind of like defined the era of that music. Like for example, rock and roll, >> it\\'s not like it stopped existing in these eras, but it definitely is. >> It\\'s not the zeitgeist anymore. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know what I mean? >> No, totally. And you know, and that\\'s the thing, right, is that like >> I think say for example, you know, um hip-hop more than anything today has is like the driving force. So I I would even argue that in some respect hip-hop is the is pop is is popular music because it\\'s it\\'s and especially when you compare it to like the 2000s it is so much more in the zit guys today than it ever was. But then you say look at you know say like de tones for instance they were definitely in their peak in the 2000s or even earlier than that right but they\\'re still around today and they\\'re still making great music. So it it it\\'s it\\'s hard to define as a whole because each genre has moved and shifted in completely different ways >> and it depends on like in your mind if you\\'re thinking of of it in like a Puritan status it\\'s like okay in your mind where do you personally view the genre fell off or where do you personally view it as it peaked? Is it commercial level? Is it like quality level? depending on how you define it. It\\'s like too multifaceted. I feel I feel like though at the end of the day, pop music I think is so much more interesting today than it has ever been because people are more open to different genre combinations. >> I\\'m listening to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] >> The fact that country music is coming back now is like no one [\\xa0__\\xa0] saw that coming in the 2000s. >> I didn\\'t even know it was gone or that it was back or anything to country music. I\\'ll be honest with you. >> Okay. Well, I\\'m I\\'m talking to the wrong crowd here. >> I know. I\\'m sorry. I I wish I could engage you more here. >> Yeah. >> Uh my my straight up answer is like >> neither. >> I Yeah, it\\'s it\\'s too broad of a topic. But I will say 2020\\'s music is probably better because there\\'s more experimentation now because there\\'s just been more time to access to making music. Absolutely. You know, you know, >> and also just the fact that the internet has granted independent musicians to actually have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] chance >> rappers. God bless. >> Well, yeah. Well, not even kidding. I\\'m just kidding. >> No, no, but like that\\'s the thing though. Like, you know, sites like Band Camp now are actually giving independent artists who probably had zero, like close to zero chance of ever breaking it into the mainstream now because of the internet actually have a chance to like get a fan base and make money and sometimes be more successful than these quote unquote mainstream artists. Whereas in the 2000s, >> if you weren\\'t part of a major label, you had no [\\xa0__\\xa0] chance. >> Yeah. >> You know, so I think 2020s is better in terms of music. >> Yeah. You have to be good to rise to the top. >> Yeah. You actually have to be good. Yeah. Good marketing or you actually have to be good or be actually unique to stand out. >> Let\\'s do the final slide then for this episode. >> Uh >> 2000s versus 2020\\'s fashion. >> I mean, >> well, you know, Jords are coming back, right? >> Everything comes back. >> Yeah. >> What I\\'ve learned is that everything comes back. >> Denim. Denim is coming back now. The only thing that doesn\\'t come back is like [\\xa0__\\xa0] 1930s and 1950s >> like the like the pugilist era like Victorian fits. >> Yeah. >> But then, you know, Lolita and um I even got recommended this one subreddit. I don\\'t even know what it was called. It was some fashion term I\\'d never heard of. >> Okay. >> Uh people loved it and it seemed like Lolita to me, but I guess it was adjacent to Lolita. >> I mean, yeah. I think fashion is literally whatever you want it to be. >> Yeah. I think 2020s is probably better in this case as well because now people have more freedom to be independent and like self-expressive. >> Nah, >> you don\\'t think so? >> Nah. >> I I will tell you one thing. >> 2000 has emo. >> I was going to say I\\'ll tell you one thing that I don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] miss is the emo and scene kids fashion. >> You don\\'t miss that? >> I do not miss that. >> No, I think you I hated it back then and I still hate it now. >> Bro, [\\xa0__\\xa0] off. You >> It\\'s I don\\'t care back then. >> I don\\'t care. Yeah, it is cringe. >> It\\'s cringe. And look, if that made you happy, then good on you. >> I won\\'t lie. >> I hate mullets, >> dude. Same. >> Mullet mullet has an aura to it of like you just like I don\\'t want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] hang out with that kind of person. >> I look at a mullet and I\\'m like you I don\\'t know why. I can\\'t prove it, but you probably beat your wife, you know? Like I >> I just >> on my flight back this morning, there were three dudes next to me who had mullets >> and they they were they were the exact type of personality you thought they were. >> And when the when the plane was taken off, I saw his phone and it was just him scrolling through Instagram. Every single post looked like another [\\xa0__\\xa0] boy at another party. I\\'m not kidding. It was like it was the exact kind of like >> I I look I\\'m guilty. I love a good phone snoop of strangers. I love seeing what strangers like what they follow and what their feed looks like. >> True. >> Um >> yeah, the mullet or energy not one I [\\xa0__\\xa0] with. >> No, not at all. >> Did you ever Did you ever own a pair of skinny jeans? >> Yeah, I used to exclusively wear skinny jeans. >> Oh, really? >> Up until like four years ago. >> Oh, 5 years ago, I used to wear only skinny jeans. >> I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever owned a pair of skinny jeans. >> But I was like I\\'m like the worst person to wear them cuz I have such fat fat ass legs. Yeah, I was going to say like how did you >> how did you get them on? >> Yeah. >> Yeah, >> the uniclo stretch ones. Stretch tunes. >> Oh, >> I would have low taper. So bottom bottom would taper >> and then the top was like normally baggier. >> All right. >> Um Yeah. >> Yeah. I don\\'t know. 2000s is just better. Just >> you\\'re just playing devil\\'s out of I respect it. K. You know what? I Yeah. You know what? Like the the [\\xa0__\\xa0] hip-hop fashion and baggy fashion. >> Yeah. Cuz this was at the peak of the bling era as well. >> That was fun. That was fun. That was fun. I will admit >> 2000 was a fun era for fashion, you know. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But that doesn\\'t mean it was all good, >> you know. >> Well, it was good for the We\\'re only saying that cuz we\\'re looking back at the 2000s. We\\'re going to look back at the 2020s and be like, yo, that\\'s this so cringy. >> I think I think like certain things will we\\'ll keep and other things will drop. every fashion like you know even even like from here and stuff I think some of the stuff some fashion aspects we\\'ve kept on to and other ones that we\\'ve just got rid of >> fashion just goes in a circle anyway it does there there\\'ll be a time probably in 10 years where 2000\\'s fashions come comes back and there\\'ll be >> I would argue it\\'s already back >> and you know what didn\\'t come back with it the emo and scene kids >> because it evolved into golf >> I saw I saw someone who um and I\\' I\\'ve made this argument trash station before and I\\'ll make it again. >> There was a there was a post I saw on on um Twitter that uh they were talking about >> there was like some extravagant looking suit. It was like crazy. Had like capes and stuff. Yeah. >> They were like, \"Why can\\'t men wear this?\" And then the someone retweet had likeund 200k likes. They were like, >> \"Men will make fun of women\\'s fashion and then wear the exact same suit.\" I\\'m like, \"You [\\xa0__\\xa0] piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] Don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] don\\'t you dare change the suit. This is the one thing that we all have and we all agree this is good and it\\'s enough.\" >> Exactly. It is the only piece of fashion that we have as men that we can all rely on and we all agree is acceptable for formal situations. The suit does not need to be changed. Do not change it. Change aspects of it. Upgrade little bits. Don\\'t you [\\xa0__\\xa0] dare change the suit. It\\'s the only thing that we have. Hopeless men who have know nothing about fashion. They know they can put on that damn suit and they\\'ll look good. >> It\\'s the only thing we have. >> Facts. >> Don\\'t change it. >> Say it louder. >> That\\'s right. That\\'s what I mean. Don\\'t [\\xa0__\\xa0] with the suit. It is ours. >> It is. It is. >> When I when you know when you talk to girls like I don\\'t know what dress I\\'m going to wear. Boys I\\'m like I know what I\\'m going to wear. A [\\xa0__\\xa0] suit. >> I have one choice. >> And thank God we have that cuz we don\\'t have to think. We just got to get that goddamn suit and we hope we fit in it. That\\'s all. >> Hundreds of years ago. >> And and you know what? There has never been a case where you don\\'t be like, \"God damn, you look good.\" When your when your friends wearing the suit, you all think like, \"God, he dressed up. He looks great. >> Immaculate.\" >> It\\'s it\\'s you know what I mean? It works. >> Men do not change the suit. But we\\'ve hit gold. Let\\'s stick with it. If other men want to fix add things to it, change >> hundreds of years. >> Good. Yeah. Let them change it if they want to change it. But but they\\'re edge cases. Our suit and our core values of the suit will not change. We\\'re keeping the damn suit. >> You know what is one like fashion resurgence that I have just never understood how it happened? >> What? >> How did Crocs become cool? >> Um >> uh because >> they moved to like limited drops and they just changed the whole marketing around it. Cuz was it was this the same thing in the UK where like if back in the 2000s when Crocs came out and you were caught wearing Crocs then it was like oh >> I can bully you. >> Uh yeah, >> but but because they were marketed at like kids and but now they\\'ve been they\\'ve they\\'ve kind of gone to hype >> and they\\'re still they\\'re still marketed at kids. >> Yeah, but they\\'re more hype beast now. >> Yeah, >> but now it\\'s Birkenstocks, bro. >> No. >> Yeah, Birkenstocks. >> No, Birkenstocks have been around for a long time. >> Yeah, but Birkenstocks are in now. >> I wear them. I know, >> dude. Birkkins were around in like [\\xa0__\\xa0] 20 years. >> No, no. I\\'m telling they\\'ve replaced the croc. The croc meta. >> No, they haven\\'t. You know what the meta is right now? It\\'s jorts and crocs. >> No, crocs. >> Yes, it is. Crocs are out, bro. >> Jorts and Crocs are the big combo now >> in the fashion world. And you know what? If you asked me 20 years ago that this was going to be the hot thing, I would have been like, I don\\'t want to live on this planet. >> I\\'m I\\'m going to die on my boat. You\\'re telling me 2020\\'s fashion is superior? >> I mean, yeah. Either way, I hate fashion. I\\'ll leave it to Jerry. >> Okay. >> I don\\'t know anything what I\\'m talking about. Okay. Okay. >> But uh thanks so much for watching this episode of Trash Taste. Let us know down below if you agree with our thoughts and if not, why?
